## Completion Status

### Phase 1: Core Documentation (Priority 1)
- [x] Task list created
- [ ] README.md - Main project overview
- [ ] docs/architecture/overview.md - System architecture
- [ ] docs/architecture/data-flow.md - Data processing patterns
- [ ] docs/architecture/components.md - Databricks deep dive
- [ ] docs/architecture/security.md - Security implementation

### Phase 2: Implementation Guides (Priority 2)  
- [ ] docs/implementation/deployment-guide.md - Deployment steps
- [ ] docs/implementation/power-bi-integration.md - BI setup
- [ ] docs/implementation/configuration.md - System config

### Phase 3: Operations (Priority 3)
- [ ] docs/operations/monitoring.md - Observability setup
- [ ] docs/operations/maintenance.md - Operational procedures
- [ ] docs/operations/troubleshooting.md - Issue resolution

### Phase 4: Resources & Best Practices (Priority 4)
- [ ] docs/resources/best-practices.md - Development guidelines
- [ ] docs/resources/performance-tuning.md - Optimization
- [ ] docs/resources/security-guidelines.md - Security standards

### Phase 5: Interactive Content (Priority 5)
- [ ] diagrams/ - Interactive architecture diagrams
- [ ] scripts/ - Deployment and utility scripts
- [ ] assets/ - Supporting files and templates

## Execution Strategy
1. Create directory structure
2. Write core documentation files (Phase 1)
3. Implementation and operations guides (Phase 2-3)
4. Supporting resources (Phase 4-5)
5. Final review and optimization

## File Size Management
- Keep individual files under 10KB for readability
- Split large content into logical sections
- Use cross-references between related documents
- Optimize for GitHub rendering and navigation

## Next Steps
Start with README.md and work through Phase 1 systematically.
