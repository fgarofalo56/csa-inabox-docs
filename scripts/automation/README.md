## 📋 Overview

This directory contains scripts for automating CI/CD processes, release management, and workflow automation for the Cloud Scale Analytics (CSA) in-a-Box documentation project. These scripts orchestrate complex workflows, manage releases, and integrate with external systems to provide seamless automation.

## 🎯 Purpose

The automation scripts are designed to:

- **Orchestrate CI/CD pipelines** for automated testing, building, and deployment
- **Manage release processes** including versioning, tagging, and changelog generation
- **Automate routine workflows** to reduce manual overhead and errors
- **Integrate with external systems** like GitHub Actions, Azure DevOps, and monitoring
- **Coordinate multi-step processes** that span multiple scripts and systems
- **Ensure quality gates** are met before releases and deployments

## 📂 Current Scripts

## 🔧 Advanced Automation Features

### Conditional Automation

**Smart Pipeline Execution:**
```bash
# Conditional execution based on changes
if [[ "$CHANGED_FILES" =~ \.md$ ]]; then
    run_documentation_pipeline
elif [[ "$CHANGED_FILES" =~ \.(py|sh)$ ]]; then
    run_code_pipeline
elif [[ "$CHANGED_FILES" =~ config/ ]]; then
    run_configuration_pipeline
fi

# Environment-specific automation
case "$ENVIRONMENT" in
    "production")
        require_manual_approval
        run_comprehensive_tests
        ;;
    "staging") 
        run_standard_tests
        auto_deploy
        ;;
    "development")
        run_basic_tests
        auto_deploy
        ;;
esac
```

### Failure Recovery

**Automated Recovery Strategies:**
```yaml
failure_recovery:
  # Pipeline failures
  pipeline_failure:
    - "Automatic retry (up to 3 times)"
    - "Notification to team"
    - "Detailed error reporting"
    - "Environment cleanup"
    
  # Deployment failures
  deployment_failure:
    - "Automatic rollback to previous version"
    - "Health check verification"
    - "Incident logging"
    - "Stakeholder notification"
    
  # Quality gate failures
  quality_failure:
    - "Block deployment"
    - "Generate detailed report"
    - "Assign to responsible team member"
    - "Track resolution"
```

### Integration Webhooks

**Webhook Integration:**
```bash
# GitHub webhook integration
github_webhook_handler() {
    local event_type="$1"
    local payload="$2"
    
    case "$event_type" in
        "push")
            trigger_ci_pipeline "$payload"
            ;;
        "pull_request") 
            trigger_pr_validation "$payload"
            ;;
        "release")
            trigger_release_pipeline "$payload"
            ;;
    esac
}

# External system notifications
notify_external_systems() {
    local event="$1"
    local data="$2"
    
    # Slack notification
    curl -X POST -H 'Content-type: application/json' \
        --data "$data" "$SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL"
    
    # Monitoring system update
    curl -X POST -H 'Content-type: application/json' \
        --data "$data" "$MONITORING_WEBHOOK_URL"
}
```

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### Common Automation Issues

| Issue | Symptoms | Cause | Solution |
|-------|----------|--------|----------|
| **Pipeline hangs** | Scripts don't complete | Waiting for user input or network timeout | Add timeouts, remove interactive prompts |
| **Authentication failures** | Can't access external services | Expired tokens or incorrect credentials | Update credentials, check token expiration |
| **Quality gate failures** | Pipeline blocked at quality checks | Code quality issues or overly strict thresholds | Fix quality issues or adjust thresholds |
| **Deployment rollbacks** | Automatic rollbacks triggered | Application issues or health check failures | Investigate application logs and fix issues |
| **Resource conflicts** | Multiple deployments interfere | Concurrent pipeline executions | Implement resource locking or queuing |

### Debug Commands

```bash
# Test pipeline stages individually
./ci-pipeline.sh --stage quality-checks --debug --dry-run
./release-manager.sh --version 1.0.0 --dry-run --verbose

# Check integration status
curl -s "$GITHUB_API_URL/repos/owner/repo/actions/runs" | jq '.workflow_runs[0]'
az account show  # Check Azure authentication

# Validate automation configuration
yamllint config/automation.yml
./scripts/automation/validate-config.sh

# Monitor pipeline execution
tail -f logs/automation.log
watch -n 5 'git log --oneline -10'
```

### Performance Optimization

**Automation Performance Tips:**
- **Parallel execution** - Run independent tasks simultaneously
- **Conditional execution** - Skip unnecessary steps based on changes
- **Caching** - Cache dependencies and build artifacts
- **Resource pooling** - Reuse environments and connections
- **Smart triggering** - Only run pipelines when needed
