# Azure Synapse Analytics Architecture

[Home](../) > Architecture

This section provides comprehensive architectural guidance for implementing Azure Synapse Analytics solutions in enterprise environments.

## Overview

Azure Synapse Analytics is Microsoft's unified analytics service that brings together enterprise data warehousing, big data processing, data integration, and AI capabilities. This architecture documentation covers proven patterns, implementation approaches, and best practices for building robust, scalable, and secure analytics solutions.

## Key Architecture Principles

1. __Unified Data Platform__: Integrate all your data assets into a cohesive ecosystem
2. __Polyglot Processing__: Choose the right compute engine for different workloads (SQL, Spark, Data Explorer)
3. __Decoupled Storage & Compute__: Scale resources independently and optimize costs
4. __Security-First Design__: Implement comprehensive security at all layers
5. __Performance Optimization__: Apply techniques for maximum throughput and query performance

## Reference Architectures

- [Delta Lakehouse Architecture](./delta-lakehouse/): Enterprise-scale lakehouse implementation using Delta Lake and Synapse Spark pools. This modern approach provides ACID transactions, schema enforcement, and time travel capabilities while maintaining the flexibility of a data lake.

- [Serverless SQL Architecture](./serverless-sql/): Pay-per-query patterns for ad-hoc analytics over data lake storage. Learn how to implement a cost-effective query layer for your data lake without provisioning infrastructure.

- [Shared Metadata Architecture](./shared-metadata/): Implementation approaches for unified semantic layers that work across Synapse engines. Create consistent metadata that can be leveraged by SQL pools, Spark pools, and external tools.

## Integration Patterns

- __Data Lake Integration__: Patterns for connecting Azure Synapse with Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2
- __Power BI Integration__: Architectural approaches for real-time and scheduled analytics visualizations
- __Azure ML Integration__: Methods for incorporating machine learning workflows into your analytics pipeline
- __CI/CD Pipeline Integration__: DevOps practices for Synapse workspace artifacts

## Architecture Decision Framework

Use this decision tree to determine the optimal Synapse architecture for your specific requirements:

1. __Primary Workload Type__:
   - Enterprise Data Warehouse → Dedicated SQL Pool
   - Data Lake Analytics → Serverless SQL + Spark
   - Real-time Analytics → Synapse Data Explorer
   - Mixed Workloads → Unified approach with multiple engines

2. __Data Volume and Velocity__:
   - TB-scale structured data → Dedicated SQL Pool
   - PB-scale mixed data → Spark + Delta Lake
   - Streaming data → Data Explorer or Spark Structured Streaming

3. __Query Patterns__:
   - Complex joins and aggregations → Dedicated SQL Pool
   - AI/ML and data science → Spark
   - Ad-hoc exploration → Serverless SQL Pool

4. __Data Governance Requirements__:
   - Enterprise-grade security → Implement Private Link, managed VNet, data exfiltration protection
   - Advanced data governance → Integrate with Microsoft Purview
   - Multi-tenant scenarios → Consider workspace isolation patterns
