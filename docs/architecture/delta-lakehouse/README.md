# Delta Lakehouse Architecture with Azure Synapse

[Home](../../) > [Architecture](../) > Delta Lakehouse

## Overview

The Delta Lakehouse architecture combines the flexibility and cost-efficiency of a data lake with the data management and ACID transaction capabilities of a data warehouse. Azure Synapse Analytics provides native integration with Delta Lake format, enabling a modern and efficient lakehouse implementation.

## Architecture Components

### Core Components

1. __Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2__
   - Foundation for storing all data in raw, refined, and curated zones
   - Hierarchical namespace for efficient file organization
   - Fine-grained ACLs for security at folder and file levels

2. __Delta Lake__
   - Open-source storage layer that brings ACID transactions to data lakes
   - Schema enforcement and evolution capabilities
   - Time travel (data versioning) for auditing and rollbacks
   - Support for optimized Parquet format for performance

3. __Azure Synapse Spark Pools__
   - Distributed processing engine for data transformation
   - Native support for Delta Lake format
   - Scalable compute for batch and stream processing
   - Integration with Azure Machine Learning for advanced analytics

4. __Azure Synapse SQL__
   - SQL interface for querying Delta tables
   - Serverless pool for ad-hoc analytics
   - Dedicated pool for enterprise data warehousing

## Implementation Patterns

### Multi-Zone Data Organization

```text
adls://data/
├── raw/                  # Raw ingested data
├── refined/              # Cleansed and conformed data
└── curated/              # Business-ready data products
```

### Medallion Architecture

The medallion architecture organizes your Delta Lake data into layers with increasing data quality and refinement:

1. __Bronze Layer__ (Raw Data)
   - Raw data ingested from source systems
   - Preserved in original format with minimal transformation
   - Append-only pattern with full history

2. __Silver Layer__ (Validated Data)
   - Cleansed, filtered, and validated data
   - Standardized schema and data types
   - Record-level metadata (processing timestamps, quality flags)

3. __Gold Layer__ (Business-Ready Data)
   - Domain-specific data models (star schema, denormalized)
   - Aggregated and enriched for specific use cases
   - Optimized for analytics performance

## Delta Lake Features in Synapse

### ACID Transactions

Delta Lake provides transactional guarantees for data lake operations:

- Atomicity: All changes succeed or fail together
- Consistency: Readers see consistent snapshots
- Isolation: Concurrent operations don't interfere
- Durability: Committed changes are permanent

### Schema Enforcement and Evolution

- Schema enforcement validates data types during writes
- Schema evolution allows controlled schema changes
- Both features prevent data corruption and ensure quality

### Time Travel

Access previous versions of data for:

- Audit trails and compliance
- Data recovery after errors
- Historical analysis and comparisons
