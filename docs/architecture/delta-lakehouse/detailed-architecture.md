# Azure Synapse Analytics Delta Lakehouse Detailed Architecture

[Home](../../../README.md) > [Architecture](../../README.md) > [Delta Lakehouse](../README.md) > Detailed Architecture
## Overview

The Delta Lakehouse architecture combines the best of data lakes and data warehouses, providing ACID transactions, schema enforcement, and time travel capabilities while maintaining the flexibility and scalability of a data lake. This document details the implementation of a Delta Lakehouse using Azure Synapse Analytics.
## Core Components

### Storage Layer

#### Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2 (ADLS Gen2)

- Hierarchical namespace for efficient directory/file operations
- Built-in security with Azure Active Directory integration
- Cost-effective storage with tiering capabilities (hot, cool, archive)
- Designed for high throughput and parallelism

#### Storage Organization

│   └── fact1/
└── gold/               # Business-level aggregated data
    ├── reports/
    └── analytics/
```

### Compute Layer

#### Azure Synapse Spark Pools

- Fully managed Apache Spark service
- Autoscaling capabilities based on workload
- Native integration with Delta Lake
- Configurable for memory-optimized or compute-optimized workloads

#### Pool Configurations

| Pool Type | Node Size | Autoscale | Use Case |
|-----------|----------|-----------|----------|
| Small | Medium (8 vCores) | 3-10 nodes | Development, testing |
| Medium | Large (16 vCores) | 5-20 nodes | Production ETL |
| Large | XLarge (32 vCores) | 10-40 nodes | Data science workloads |

### Delta Lake Integration

#### Key Components

- Transaction log for ACID compliance
- Optimistic concurrency control
- Schema enforcement and evolution
- Data skipping and Z-ordering for query optimization
- Time travel capabilities

#### Implementation

```python
# Example of configuring Spark with Delta Lake
spark = SparkSession.builder \
    .appName("Delta Lake Configuration") \
    .config("spark.sql.extensions", "io.delta.sql.DeltaSparkSessionExtension") \
    .config("spark.sql.catalog.spark_catalog", "org.apache.spark.sql.delta.catalog.DeltaCatalog") \
    .getOrCreate()

# Setting Delta specific configurations
spark.conf.set("spark.databricks.delta.properties.defaults.enableChangeDataFeed", "true")
spark.conf.set("spark.databricks.delta.optimize.maxFileSize", 1024 * 1024 * 256)  # 256MB
spark.conf.set("spark.databricks.delta.autoCompact.enabled", "true")
```

## Architecture Patterns

### Bronze-Silver-Gold Pattern

#### Bronze Layer (Raw Data)

- Ingests data in raw format with minimal transformation
- Preserves original data for auditing and reprocessing
- Implemented as Delta tables with schema inference
- Retention policies based on compliance requirements

#### Silver Layer (Processed Data)

- Cleaned and conformed data
- Standardized formats and data types
- Data quality checks and validation
- Implemented as Delta tables with strict schemas

#### Gold Layer (Business Data)

- Aggregated, enriched data ready for consumption
- Optimized for specific business domains or use cases
- Often dimensional models or denormalized structures
- Implemented as Delta tables optimized for query performance

### Data Ingestion Patterns

#### Batch Ingestion

- Using Azure Synapse pipelines for orchestration
- Scheduled or event-triggered processing
- Support for various source formats (CSV, JSON, Parquet, etc.)
- Parallel loading for high-volume data

#### Stream Ingestion

- Integration with Azure Event Hubs or Kafka
- Real-time processing with Structured Streaming
- Delta Lake's support for streaming writes
- Auto-compaction for optimizing small files

### Data Processing Patterns

#### ELT (Extract, Load, Transform)

- Load raw data into Bronze layer
- Transform in-place using Spark SQL or DataFrame APIs
- Move processed data to Silver and Gold layers
- Leverages Synapse's distributed processing capabilities
- Optimize and manage metadata with VACUUM and ANALYZE

## Advanced Features

### Time Travel and Versioning

Delta Lake provides time travel capabilities, allowing queries against previous versions of the data. This is particularly useful for:

- Auditing and compliance
- Debugging and rollback scenarios
- Point-in-time analysis
- Reproducible reporting

```sql
-- Query data as of a specific timestamp
SELECT * FROM delta.`/path/to/table` TIMESTAMP AS OF '2025-08-01 00:00:00'

-- Query data as of a specific version
SELECT * FROM delta.`/path/to/table` VERSION AS OF 123
```

### Schema Evolution

Delta Lake supports schema evolution, allowing tables to adapt as data structures change over time:

- Add new columns
- Change data types (with compatible conversions)
- Rename columns using column mapping

```sql
-- Add a new column with a default value
ALTER TABLE delta_table ADD COLUMN new_column STRING DEFAULT 'default_value'
```

### Change Data Capture (CDC)

Delta Lake supports Change Data Feed, enabling downstream systems to consume only changed data:

```python
# Enable CDC on a Delta table
spark.sql("ALTER TABLE delta_table SET TBLPROPERTIES (delta.enableChangeDataFeed = true)")

# Read changes between versions
changes = spark.read.format("delta") \
    .option("readChangeFeed", "true") \
    .option("startingVersion", 5) \
    .option("endingVersion", 10) \
    .table("delta_table")
```

### Optimizations

#### Data Skipping

- Delta Lake maintains statistics on data files
- Query predicates use these statistics to skip irrelevant files
- Significantly improves query performance

#### Z-Ordering

- Multi-dimensional clustering technique
- Colocates related data together
- Improves query performance when filtering on Z-ordered columns

```sql
-- Z-order by multiple columns
OPTIMIZE delta_table ZORDER BY (date_column, region_column)
```

#### File Compaction

- Combines small files into larger ones
- Reduces metadata overhead
- Improves scan performance

```sql
-- Compact files without Z-ordering
OPTIMIZE delta_table
```

## Security and Governance

### Authentication and Authorization

#### Azure Active Directory Integration

- Single sign-on with Azure AD
- Role-based access control (RBAC)
- Integration with existing identity systems
- Support for managed identities

#### Fine-grained Access Control

- Table-level and column-level security
- Row-level security through Delta Lake filters
- Dynamic data masking for sensitive fields

### Data Governance

#### Azure Purview Integration

- Automated data discovery and classification
- Data lineage tracking
- Sensitive data identification
- Centralized metadata management

#### Metadata Management

- Schema history tracking
- Transaction history logging
- Origin tracking with detailed provenance
- Integration with external metadata systems

## Monitoring and Optimization

### Performance Monitoring

#### Azure Monitor Integration

- Resource utilization tracking
- Query performance metrics
- Cost analysis
- Alerting on performance degradation

#### Delta-specific Metrics

- Transaction log size and growth rate
- Data skipping effectiveness
- Compaction efficiency
- Read/write throughput

### Cost Optimization Strategies

#### Storage Optimization

- Tiered storage policies
- Data lifecycle management
- Vacuum operations to remove stale files
- Compression settings optimization

#### Compute Optimization

- Right-sizing Spark pools
- Autoscaling configurations
- Workload isolation for predictable performance
- Caching strategies for frequently accessed data

## Integration Points
