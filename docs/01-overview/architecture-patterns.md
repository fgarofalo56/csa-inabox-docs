## 🎯 Overview

This document provides an overview of the architecture patterns available for implementing Azure Cloud Scale Analytics solutions.

Azure cloud analytics solutions can be implemented using various proven architectural patterns, each suited for different scenarios and requirements. Understanding these patterns helps you choose the right approach for your specific use case.

## ✨ Key Features

- **Streaming Architectures** - Real-time data processing patterns (Lambda, Kappa, Event Sourcing)
- **Batch Architectures** - Large-scale batch processing patterns (Medallion, Data Mesh, Hub-Spoke)  
- **Hybrid Architectures** - Combined streaming and batch patterns (Lambda-Kappa, HTAP, Polyglot)
- **Reference Architectures** - Industry-specific implementations and best practices

## 🛠️ Implementation

To implement these patterns:

1. Review the specific pattern documentation in the [Architecture Patterns](../03-architecture-patterns/README.md) section
2. Assess your requirements and constraints
3. Select the most appropriate pattern for your use case
4. Follow the implementation guides and best practices
5. Adapt the pattern to your specific needs

## 💡 Best Practices

- Choose patterns based on requirements, not trends
- Start with proven patterns before customizing
- Consider scalability and maintainability
- Document your architectural decisions
- Plan for evolution and change

## 📝 Examples

See the [Implementation Guides](../04-implementation-guides/README.md) for complete examples of these patterns in action.
