- [Query Performance](/docs/best-practices/performance.md#query-performance) - SQL query optimization techniques
- [Spark Job Optimization](/docs/best-practices/performance.md#spark-optimization) - Apache Spark tuning for analytics workloads
- [Resource Management](/docs/best-practices/performance.md#resource-management) - Best practices for managing compute resources

### Security and Governance

!!! warning "Security First"
    Security should be implemented as a foundational element of your Azure Synapse Analytics implementation, not as an afterthought.

- [Security Best Practices](/docs/best-practices/security.md) - Comprehensive security guidance
- [Network Security](/docs/best-practices/security.md#network-security) - VNet integration and network isolation
- [Data Protection](/docs/best-practices/security.md#data-protection) - Encryption, masking, and access control
- [Compliance](/docs/best-practices/security.md#compliance) - Meeting regulatory requirements

### Cost Management

!!! abstract "Optimizing Costs"
    Azure Synapse Analytics offers various pricing models and optimization opportunities to manage costs effectively while maintaining performance.

- [Serverless vs. Dedicated](/docs/best-practices/cost-optimization.md#choosing-compute) - Choosing the right compute model
- [Autoscaling](/docs/best-practices/cost-optimization.md#autoscaling) - Dynamic resource allocation
- [Monitoring and Reporting](/docs/best-practices/cost-optimization.md#monitoring) - Tracking and analyzing costs

### Implementation Patterns

!!! example "Implementation Guidance"
    Follow these proven implementation patterns to accelerate your Azure Synapse Analytics deployment and ensure success.

- [Implementation Patterns](/docs/best-practices/implementation-patterns.md) - Architectural patterns
- [Data Governance](/docs/best-practices/data-governance.md) - Establishing data quality and governance

- [Monitoring and Operations](/docs/monitoring/logging-monitoring-guide.md) - Operational excellence

## Recommended Approach

When implementing Azure Synapse Analytics, we recommend following this phased approach:

1. __Establish Foundation__ - Set up networking, security, and governance
2. __Implement Core Infrastructure__ - Deploy and configure Synapse workspace and storage
3. __Develop Initial Workloads__ - Start with high-value use cases
4. __Optimize__ - Tune performance and costs based on actual usage
5. __Scale__ - Expand to additional use cases and data sources
