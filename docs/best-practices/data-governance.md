  # Check for null values in critical columns
  def check_null_values(df, column_name):
      null_count = df.filter(col(column_name).isNull()).count()
      total_count = df.count()
      return {
          "column": column_name,
          "null_count": null_count,
          "total_count": total_count,

  ```json
  {
    "location": "East US",
    "tags": {
      "DataResidency": "US",
      "DataClassification": "Confidential"
    }
  }
  ```

- __Restricted__: Highly sensitive information with strictly controlled access

#### Implementation

- __Automated Discovery__: Use pattern matching and ML for initial classification

- __Manual Review__: Human verification of sensitive data classification

- __Classification Maintenance__: Regular review and update of classifications

### Access Controls

#### Data-Level Security

- __Row-Level Security (RLS)__: Control data access at the row level

  ```sql
  -- Create security predicate function
  CREATE FUNCTION dbo.fn_securitypredicate(@Region NVARCHAR(50))
      RETURNS TABLE
  WITH SCHEMABINDING
  AS
      RETURN SELECT 1 AS fn_securitypredicate_result
      WHERE @Region IN (SELECT [Region] FROM dbo.UserRegions WHERE [User] = USER_NAME())
      OR IS_MEMBER('db_owner') = 1;

  -- Create security policy
  CREATE SECURITY POLICY RegionalDataFilter
  ADD FILTER PREDICATE dbo.fn_securitypredicate(Region)
  ON dbo.SalesData
  WITH (STATE = ON);
  ```

- __Dynamic Data Masking__: Mask sensitive data for unauthorized users

  ```sql
  ALTER TABLE customers
  ALTER COLUMN email ADD MASKED WITH (FUNCTION = 'email()');

  ALTER TABLE customers
  ALTER COLUMN phone ADD MASKED WITH (FUNCTION = 'partial(1,"XXXXXXX",4)');
  ```
