  from pyspark.sql.functions import col, when, count
  
  # Check for null values in critical columns
  def check_null_values(df, column_name):
      null_count = df.filter(col(column_name).isNull()).count()
      total_count = df.count()
      return {
          "column": column_name,
          "null_count": null_count,
          "total_count": total_count,
          "null_percentage": (null_count / total_count) * 100 if total_count > 0 else 0
      }
  ```

  ```json
  {
    "location": "East US",
    "tags": {
      "DataResidency": "US",
      "DataClassification": "Confidential"
    }
  }
  ```

## Data Security Classifications

### Classification Framework

#### Sensitivity Levels
- **Public**: Information freely available to anyone
- **Internal**: Information for use within the organization only
- **Confidential**: Sensitive information with restricted access
- **Restricted**: Highly sensitive information with strictly controlled access

#### Implementation
- **Automated Discovery**: Use pattern matching and ML for initial classification
- **Manual Review**: Human verification of sensitive data classification
- **Classification Maintenance**: Regular review and update of classifications

### Access Controls

#### Data-Level Security
- **Row-Level Security (RLS)**: Control data access at the row level
  ```sql
  -- Create security predicate function
  CREATE FUNCTION dbo.fn_securitypredicate(@Region NVARCHAR(50))
      RETURNS TABLE
  WITH SCHEMABINDING
  AS
      RETURN SELECT 1 AS fn_securitypredicate_result
      WHERE @Region IN (SELECT [Region] FROM dbo.UserRegions WHERE [User] = USER_NAME())
      OR IS_MEMBER('db_owner') = 1;
  
  -- Create security policy
  CREATE SECURITY POLICY RegionalDataFilter
  ADD FILTER PREDICATE dbo.fn_securitypredicate(Region)
  ON dbo.SalesData
  WITH (STATE = ON);
  ```
- **Column-Level Security**: Restrict access to specific columns
- **Dynamic Data Masking**: Mask sensitive data for unauthorized users
  ```sql
  ALTER TABLE customers
  ALTER COLUMN email ADD MASKED WITH (FUNCTION = 'email()');
  
  ALTER TABLE customers
  ALTER COLUMN phone ADD MASKED WITH (FUNCTION = 'partial(1,"XXXXXXX",4)');
  ```
