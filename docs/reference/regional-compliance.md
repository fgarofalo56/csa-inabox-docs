from azure.identity import DefaultAzureCredential
from azure.synapse.artifacts import ArtifactsClient
import logging

# Configure audit logging
logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO)
logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)

def query_personal_data_gdpr_compliant(user_id: str, purpose: str):
    """
    Query personal data with GDPR compliance controls.

    Args:
        user_id: Subject identifier
        purpose: Legitimate processing purpose
    """
    # Log access for audit trail
    logger.info(f"GDPR Data Access: user={user_id}, purpose={purpose}")

    # Query with column-level security
    query = f"""
    SELECT
        user_id,
        -- Pseudonymized fields
        HASHBYTES('SHA2_256', email) as email_hash,
        -- Minimized data set
        country,
        consent_status
    FROM personal_data
    WHERE user_id = '{user_id}'
    AND data_region = 'EU'
    AND consent_status = 'granted'
    """

    return query

def delete_user_data_gdpr(user_id: str):
    """
    Exercise right to erasure - delete all user data.

    Args:
        user_id: Subject identifier to delete
    """
    logger.info(f"GDPR Data Deletion: user={user_id}")

    # Cascade delete across all tables
    delete_queries = [
        f"DELETE FROM transactions WHERE user_id = '{user_id}'",
        f"DELETE FROM user_profile WHERE user_id = '{user_id}'",
        f"DELETE FROM consent_records WHERE user_id = '{user_id}'"
    ]

    return delete_queries
```

```

### Implementation Considerations

#### 1. Region Selection Strategy

```yaml
# deployment-config.yaml
regional_deployments:
  europe:
    primary_region: "West Europe"
    paired_region: "North Europe"
    data_residency: "EU"
    compliance: ["GDPR", "ISO 27001"]

  north_america:
    primary_region: "East US"
    paired_region: "West US"
    data_residency: "US"
    compliance: ["SOC 2", "HIPAA"]

  asia_pacific:
    primary_region: "Southeast Asia"
    paired_region: "East Asia"
    data_residency: "Singapore"
    compliance: ["PDPA", "ISO 27001"]
```

#### 2. Data Residency Enforcement

```python
# enforce_data_residency.py
def validate_data_residency(resource_group: str, region: str, compliance_requirement: str):
    """
    Validate that resources comply with data residency requirements.

    Args:
        resource_group: Azure resource group name
        region: Target Azure region
        compliance_requirement: Required compliance framework
    """
    approved_regions = {
        "GDPR": ["westeurope", "northeurope", "francecentral", "germanywestcentral"],
        "HIPAA": ["eastus", "westus", "centralus", "eastus2"],
        "PDPA": ["southeastasia", "eastasia"],
    }

    if region.lower() not in approved_regions.get(compliance_requirement, []):
        raise ValueError(
            f"Region {region} not approved for {compliance_requirement} compliance. "
            f"Approved regions: {approved_regions[compliance_requirement]}"
        )

    return True
```

|--------|--------------|-------|
| East US | Baseline (1.0x) | Reference pricing |
| West Europe | ~1.1x | Higher energy costs |
| UK South | ~1.15x | Higher operational costs |
| Australia East | ~1.2x | Geographic distance, infrastructure |
| Japan East | ~1.15x | Local market conditions |
| Brazil South | ~1.25x | Import taxes, infrastructure |
| UAE North | ~1.1x | Regional infrastructure |

### Cost Optimization Strategies

#### 1. Multi-Region Cost Analysis

```python
# cost_calculator.py
def calculate_regional_cost(
    compute_hours: float,
    storage_gb: float,
    region: str
) -> dict:
    """
    Calculate estimated costs for different regions.

    Args:
        compute_hours: Spark pool compute hours per month
        storage_gb: Storage in gigabytes
        region: Azure region name

    Returns:
        Cost breakdown by component
    """
    # Base pricing (East US)
    base_compute_per_hour = 0.50
    base_storage_per_gb = 0.02

    # Regional multipliers
    regional_multipliers = {
        "eastus": 1.0,
        "westeurope": 1.1,
        "uksouth": 1.15,
        "australiaeast": 1.2,
        "brazilsouth": 1.25
    }

    multiplier = regional_multipliers.get(region, 1.0)

    compute_cost = compute_hours * base_compute_per_hour * multiplier
    storage_cost = storage_gb * base_storage_per_gb * multiplier

    return {
        "region": region,
        "compute_cost": round(compute_cost, 2),
        "storage_cost": round(storage_cost, 2),
        "total_cost": round(compute_cost + storage_cost, 2),
        "multiplier": multiplier
    }
```

#### 2. Cost-Effective Region Selection

```bash
# Compare costs across regions
az consumption budget create \
  --budget-name "multi-region-comparison" \
  --amount 5000 \
  --time-grain Monthly \
  --start-date "2025-01-01" \
  --resource-group-filter "rg-synapse-*"
```

### Tax and Billing Considerations

| Region | VAT/Tax Rate | Billing Currency | Notes |
|--------|--------------|------------------|-------|
| EU Regions | 19-25% VAT | EUR | VAT varies by member state |
| US Regions | 0-10% Sales Tax | USD | State/local taxes may apply |
| UK | 20% VAT | GBP | Post-Brexit regulations |
| Australia | 10% GST | AUD | Goods and Services Tax |
| Japan | 10% Consumption Tax | JPY | Includes local consumption tax |
| Canada | 5-15% GST/HST | CAD | Provincial variations |

Data sovereignty refers to the concept that data is subject to the laws and governance structures of the nation where it is collected or resides.

### Sovereignty Requirements by Region

#### European Union

- __Requirements__: Data must remain within EU borders unless adequate protection guaranteed
- __Mechanism__: Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs)
- __Impact__: EU-only deployments common for sensitive data

#### China

- __Requirements__: Critical Information Infrastructure (CII) data must be stored locally
- __Mechanism__: Security assessments for data transfers
- __Impact__: Azure China (21Vianet) separate offering

#### Russia

- __Requirements__: Russian citizen data must be stored on servers in Russia
- __Mechanism__: Federal Law No. 242-FZ
- __Impact__: Local data center requirements

## Cross-Border Data Transfer

### Transfer Mechanisms

#### Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs)

Microsoft provides SCCs for data transfers from EU to third countries:

```yaml
transfer_mechanism:
  type: "Standard Contractual Clauses"
  version: "2021 EU SCC"
  parties:
    data_exporter: "Customer"
    data_importer: "Microsoft Corporation"
  safeguards:
    - encryption
    - access_controls
    - audit_logging
    - data_minimization
```

#### Binding Corporate Rules (BCRs)

For multinational organizations:

- Approved by EU Data Protection Authorities
- Cover intra-group transfers
- Require comprehensive documentation

### Transfer Impact Assessment

Before transferring data cross-border:

1. __Identify Data Types__
   - Personal data categories
   - Sensitivity levels
   - Processing purposes

2. __Assess Destination__
   - Adequacy decision status
   - Local laws and practices
   - Government access provisions

3. __Implement Safeguards__
   - Encryption
   - Access controls
   - Contractual protections

4. __Document Decision__
   - Transfer Impact Assessment (TIA)
   - Risk mitigation measures
   - Approval records

### Example Transfer Configuration

```python
# cross_border_transfer.py
class DataTransferController:
    """Control cross-border data transfers with compliance checks."""

    def __init__(self, source_region: str, destination_region: str):
        self.source = source_region
        self.destination = destination_region
        self.approved = False

    def assess_transfer(self) -> bool:
        """
        Assess if data transfer is compliant.

        Returns:
            True if transfer approved, False otherwise
        """
        # Check if adequacy decision exists
        adequacy_decisions = ["EU-US DPF", "UK", "Switzerland", "Canada"]

        if self.destination in adequacy_decisions:
            self.approved = True
            return True

        # Check if SCCs in place
        if self.has_sccs():
            self.approved = True
            return True

        return False

    def has_sccs(self) -> bool:
        """Check if Standard Contractual Clauses are in place."""
        # Implementation to verify SCC agreements
        return True

    def transfer_data(self, data: dict):
        """Execute compliant data transfer."""
        if not self.approved:
            raise PermissionError("Data transfer not approved")

        # Log transfer for audit
        self.log_transfer(data)

        # Execute transfer with encryption
        return self.execute_encrypted_transfer(data)
```
