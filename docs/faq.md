RETURNS TABLE
WITH SCHEMABINDING
AS
RETURN SELECT 1 AS fn_securitypredicate_result
WHERE @Region = CAST(SESSION_CONTEXT(N'UserRegion') AS VARCHAR(50))
   OR IS_MEMBER('db_owner') = 1;

-- Apply security policy
CREATE SECURITY POLICY RegionSecurityPolicy
ADD FILTER PREDICATE dbo.fn_RegionFilter(Region)
ON dbo.SalesData
WITH (STATE = ON);
```

## 📊 Data Management Questions

### ❓ How long should I retain Delta Lake transaction logs?

> 🗂️ __Log Retention Strategy__
> Balance compliance requirements with storage costs:

| Scenario | Retention Period | Configuration | Reason |
|----------|-----------------|---------------|--------|
