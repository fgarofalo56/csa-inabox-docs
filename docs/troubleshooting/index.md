## Collecting Diagnostic Information

!!! info "Essential Information to Gather"
    Before diving into specific troubleshooting steps, gather the following information:

```markdown
    1. **Error Messages**: Capture the full text of any error messages
    2. **Timestamp**: Note when the issue occurred
    3. **Resource Details**: Workspace name, pool configuration, operation being performed
    4. **Environment Information**: Network configuration, firewall settings, resource constraints
    5. **Recent Changes**: Any recent changes to configurations, code, or infrastructure
```

!!! warning "Don't Overlook Log Timestamps"
    When reviewing logs, pay attention to the timezone of log entries. Azure logs may use UTC time rather than your local time zone.
