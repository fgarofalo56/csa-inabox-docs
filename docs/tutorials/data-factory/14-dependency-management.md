## 🔗 Activity Dependencies

### Sequential Execution

```json
{
  "name": "Activity2",
  "type": "Copy",
  "dependsOn": [
    {
      "activity": "Activity1",
      "dependencyConditions": ["Succeeded"]
    }
  ]
}
```

### Multiple Dependencies

```json
{
  "name": "FinalActivity",
  "type": "Copy",
  "dependsOn": [
    {"activity": "Activity1", "dependencyConditions": ["Succeeded"]},
    {"activity": "Activity2", "dependencyConditions": ["Succeeded"]},
    {"activity": "Activity3", "dependencyConditions": ["Succeeded"]}
  ]
}
```

## 🎯 Dependency Conditions

Available conditions:

- `Succeeded`: Activity completed successfully
- `Failed`: Activity failed
- `Skipped`: Activity was skipped
- `Completed`: Activity completed (success or failure)

## ⚡ Parallel Execution

Execute activities in parallel when no dependencies exist.
