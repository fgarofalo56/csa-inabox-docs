## 📈 Step 1: Spike and Dip Detection

### __1.1 Basic Spike Detection__

Detect sudden increases in metric values:

```sql
-- Detect temperature spikes using built-in ML function
SELECT
    deviceId,
    location,
    timestamp,
    temperature,
    CAST(AnomalyDetection_SpikeAndDip(temperature, 95, 120, 'spikes') OVER(LIMIT DURATION(minute, 10)) AS RECORD) AS spikeScore
INTO
    BlobOutput
FROM
    EventHubInput TIMESTAMP BY timestamp;
```

__Parameters Explained:__
- __95__: Confidence level (95% confidence)
- __120__: History window size (120 events)
- __'spikes'__: Detect only spikes (can be 'dips' or 'spikesanddips')

### __1.2 Extract Anomaly Details__

Parse the anomaly detection output:

```sql
-- Extract spike detection details
WITH SpikeDetection AS (
    SELECT
        deviceId,
        location,
        timestamp,
        temperature,
        CAST(AnomalyDetection_SpikeAndDip(temperature, 95, 120, 'spikes')
            OVER(LIMIT DURATION(minute, 10)) AS RECORD) AS spikeResult
    FROM
        EventHubInput TIMESTAMP BY timestamp
)

        WHEN spikeResult.IsAnomaly = 1 AND spikeResult.Score > 0.5 THEN 'Warning Spike'
        WHEN spikeResult.IsAnomaly = 1 THEN 'Minor Spike'
        ELSE 'Normal'
    END AS severityLevel
INTO
    SqlOutput
FROM
    SpikeDetection
WHERE
    spikeResult.IsAnomaly = 1;  -- Only output anomalies
```

### __1.3 Detect Both Spikes and Dips__

        WHEN changePointResult.IsAnomaly = 1 THEN 'Weak Trend Change'
        ELSE 'Stable Trend'
    END AS trendStatus,
    -- Calculate temperature trend
    temperature - LAG(temperature) OVER(PARTITION BY deviceId LIMIT DURATION(minute, 30)) AS recentTempChange,
    -- Alert type
    CASE
        WHEN changePointResult.IsAnomaly = 1 THEN 'Trend Change Alert'

```

## 🔍 Step 3: Custom Anomaly Detection

### __3.1 Statistical Threshold Detection__

    CASE
        WHEN stdDevTemp > 0 THEN (temperature - avgTemp) / stdDevTemp
        ELSE 0
    END AS zScore,

    location,
    timestamp,
    temperature,
    median AS medianTemperature,
    p05 AS lowerBound,
    p95 AS upperBound,
    CASE
        WHEN temperature > p95 THEN 'High Outlier'
        WHEN temperature < p05 THEN 'Low Outlier'
        ELSE 'Within Range'
    END AS outlierStatus,
    CASE
        WHEN temperature > p95 THEN temperature - p95
        WHEN temperature < p05 THEN p05 - temperature
        ELSE 0

## 🎓 Key Concepts Learned

### __Anomaly Detection Methods__

| Method | Best For | Sensitivity |
|--------|----------|-------------|
| __SpikeAndDip__ | Sudden value changes | High |
| __ChangePoint__ | Trend shifts | Medium |
| __Z-Score__ | Statistical outliers | Configurable |
| __Percentile__ | Distribution-based detection | Medium |
| __Rate of Change__ | Rapid transitions | High |

### __Best Practices__

- Combine multiple detection methods for accuracy
- Tune confidence levels based on false positive tolerance
- Use appropriate history window sizes (100-200 events)
- Partition by deviceId for device-specific baselines
- Filter output to anomalies only to reduce noise
