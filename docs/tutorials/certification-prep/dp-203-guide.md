INNER HASH JOIN dbo.DimProduct dp ON fs.ProductKey = dp.ProductKey
OPTION (FORCE ORDER);

-- Problem: Large result set scan
-- Solution: Create materialized view

## 📊 Practice Exam Questions

### __Question Set 1: Storage Design (Domain 1)__

__Q1__: You are designing a data lake for IoT sensor data. Sensors generate 1KB JSON messages every second. You need to optimize query performance and minimize storage costs. What should you do?

A) Store raw JSON files directly in Data Lake
B) Convert to CSV and compress with GZIP
__C) Convert to Parquet format partitioned by date__
D) Store in Azure SQL Database

__Explanation__: Parquet provides columnar compression and excellent query performance. Date partitioning enables partition pruning for time-based queries.

---

__Q2__: You need to implement Type 2 Slowly Changing Dimension for customer addresses. Which columns should you add?

A) LastModifiedDate
__B) StartDate, EndDate, IsCurrent__
C) Version, ModifiedBy
D) CreatedDate, IsDeleted

__Explanation__: SCD Type 2 requires tracking when each version was valid (StartDate, EndDate) and which is current (IsCurrent flag).

---

### __Question Set 2: Data Processing (Domain 2)__

__Q3__: A Spark job fails with "OutOfMemoryError: Java heap space" when processing 500GB of data. What should you try first?

A) Increase the number of executors
__B) Increase executor memory and optimize shuffle operations__
C) Repartition data into more files
D) Use a smaller dataset

__Explanation__: OOM errors typically indicate insufficient executor memory or inefficient shuffles. Increase memory and optimize joins/aggregations first.

__Q4__: You need to calculate 30-day moving average updated every day. Which Stream Analytics window?

A) TumblingWindow(day, 1)
__B) HoppingWindow(day, 30, 1)__
C) SlidingWindow(day, 30)
D) SessionWindow(day, 30)

__Explanation__: Hopping window with size=30 days and hop=1 day creates overlapping 30-day windows updated daily.

---

### __Question Set 3: Security & Optimization (Domain 3)__

__Q5__: You need to ensure analysts can see all columns except Social Security Numbers in a customer table. What should you implement?

A) Row-level security
B) Stored procedure access only
__C) Dynamic data masking or column-level security__
D) Azure RBAC

__Explanation__: Column-level security or dynamic data masking restricts specific column visibility while allowing other columns to be accessed.

---

__Q6__: A query on 1TB fact table takes 10 minutes. Statistics are current. What should you check first?

A) Network latency
B) Executor configuration
__C) Query execution plan for scan vs seek operations__
D) Storage throughput

__Explanation__: Execution plan reveals if query is doing full table scan vs index seek, which is primary cause of slow queries.
