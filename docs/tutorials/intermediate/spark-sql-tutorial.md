__Master Spark SQL for distributed data processing. Learn advanced queries, optimization, and best practices.__

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

- Write efficient Spark SQL queries
- Use window functions and CTEs
- Optimize query performance
- Work with complex data types
- Implement data quality checks

## 📋 Prerequisites

- [ ] __Spark cluster__ - Databricks or HDInsight

## 📊 Advanced Queries

```sql
-- Window functions
SELECT
    customer_id,
    order_date,
    amount,
    SUM(amount) OVER (
        PARTITION BY customer_id
        ORDER BY order_date
        ROWS BETWEEN UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW
    ) as running_total,
    ROW_NUMBER() OVER (
        PARTITION BY customer_id
        ORDER BY amount DESC
    ) as purchase_rank
FROM orders;
```

## 🎯 Performance Tips

- Use Catalyst optimizer
