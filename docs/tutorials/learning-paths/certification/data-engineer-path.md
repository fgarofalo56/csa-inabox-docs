- Reserve 15 minutes at the end for review

**Question Strategies:**
- Read each question carefully - twice
- Eliminate obviously wrong answers first
- Watch for keywords: "BEST", "MOST", "LEAST"
- Case studies: Read questions first, then scenario
- Drag-and-drop: Think about logical sequence
- Multi-select: Read all options before selecting

**Common Traps to Avoid:**
- L Choosing solutions that work but aren't optimal
- L Selecting on-premises solutions when cloud-native exists
- L Ignoring cost optimization considerations
- L Overlooking security and governance requirements
- L Choosing complex solutions when simple ones suffice

### Data Processing Patterns

```python
# Medallion Architecture Pattern
bronze_layer = raw_ingested_data()
silver_layer = cleaned_and_validated(bronze_layer)
gold_layer = business_aggregations(silver_layer)

# Slowly Changing Dimension Type 2
def scd_type2_merge(source, target):
    # Close expired records
    # Insert new records with current flag
    # Update effective dates
    pass

# Delta Lake Optimization
OPTIMIZE table_name ZORDER BY (column1, column2)
VACUUM table_name RETAIN 168 HOURS
```

### Performance Tuning Checklist

**Spark Optimization:**
- Partition data appropriately (aim for 128MB per partition)
- Use broadcast joins for small tables (<10MB)
- Persist DataFrames when reused multiple times
- Use partitionBy() for frequently filtered columns
- Avoid shuffle operations when possible

**SQL Pool Optimization:**
- Use clustered columnstore indexes for large tables
- Implement hash distribution for large fact tables
- Use round robin for staging tables
- Update statistics after significant data changes
- Use result set caching for repeated queries

### Security Checklist

-  Enable encryption at rest and in transit
-  Implement RBAC with principle of least privilege
-  Use Managed Identities instead of credentials
-  Implement row-level and column-level security
-  Enable data masking for sensitive columns
