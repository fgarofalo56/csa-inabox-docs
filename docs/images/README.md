2. Maintain a 16:9 aspect ratio when appropriate
3. Use the Azure icon set for Azure services
4. Include alt text in markdown references
5. Keep file sizes optimized (< 200KB when possible)
6. Use PNG format for diagrams and screenshots
7. Store all images in this central directory
8. Reference from markdown using relative paths

## Image Naming Convention

- Use lowercase kebab-case for all image filenames
- Include descriptive names that indicate content
- Include component names when appropriate
- Avoid generic names like "diagram1.png"
