# PLACEHOLDER FOR MULTI-REGION DEPLOYMENT ARCHITECTURE DIAGRAM

This file serves as a placeholder for the static image rendering of the Multi-Region Deployment Architecture diagram.

## Diagram Description

This diagram illustrates an enterprise deployment of Azure Synapse Analytics requiring high availability and global distribution, featuring:

- Primary Region with core components (ADLS Gen2, Spark Pool, Serverless SQL, Delta Lake)
- Disaster Recovery Region with replicated components
- Global Regions with Serverless SQL endpoints for regional data access
- Data replication paths between the Primary Region and other regions
- Region-to-region relationships for failover and data distribution

## Original Mermaid Code

```mermaid
graph TD
    PR[Primary Region] --> DR[Disaster Recovery Region]
    PR --> GR1[Global Region 1]
    PR --> GR2[Global Region 2]
    
    subgraph Primary Region
    PRADLS[ADLS Gen2] --> PRSP[Spark Pool]
    PRADLS --> PRSQL[Serverless SQL]
    PRSP --> PRDL[Delta Lake]
    end
    
    subgraph Disaster Recovery Region
    DRADLS[ADLS Gen2] --> DRSP[Spark Pool]
    DRADLS --> DRSQL[Serverless SQL]
    DRSP --> DRDL[Delta Lake]
    end
    
    PRADLS --> DRADLS
    
    subgraph Global Region 1
    GR1SQL[Serverless SQL]
    end
    
    subgraph Global Region 2
    GR2SQL[Serverless SQL]
    end
    
    DRADLS --> GR1SQL
    DRADLS --> GR2SQL
```
