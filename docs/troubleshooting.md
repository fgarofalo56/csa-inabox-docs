# Troubleshooting Guide

This guide covers common issues and solutions when working with Azure Synapse Analytics.

## Connection Issues

### Cannot connect to Synapse workspace

**Symptoms**: Unable to access Synapse Studio or connect to the workspace.

**Possible Causes and Solutions**:

1. **Network Connectivity**:
   - Ensure your network allows connections to the Azure Synapse service endpoints
   - Check if firewall rules are properly configured in the Azure portal
   - Verify you're using the correct workspace URL

2. **Authentication Issues**:
   - Confirm you have the appropriate permissions to access the workspace
   - Check if your Azure Active Directory credentials are valid
   - Try signing out and signing back in to refresh authentication tokens

3. **Service Outage**:
   - Check the [Azure Status page](https://status.azure.com) for any ongoing service issues

## Performance Problems

### Slow Query Performance in Dedicated SQL Pools

**Symptoms**: Queries take longer than expected to complete.

**Possible Causes and Solutions**:

1. **Suboptimal Distribution**:
   - Verify table distribution keys are appropriate for common query patterns
   - Check for data skew using `DBCC PDW_SHOWSPACEUSED`
   - Consider redistributing tables with high skew

2. **Statistics Issues**:
   - Ensure statistics are up-to-date using `UPDATE STATISTICS`
   - Check for missing statistics in execution plans

3. **Resource Constraints**:
   - Monitor resource utilization during query execution
   - Consider scaling up the SQL pool during peak workloads
   - Implement query concurrency management

### Spark Jobs Failing or Running Slowly

**Symptoms**: Spark notebooks or jobs time out, fail, or perform poorly.

**Possible Causes and Solutions**:

1. **Resource Allocation**:
   - Check if the Spark pool has sufficient memory and cores
   - Monitor executor memory usage and adjust configurations
   - Consider increasing the executor count for large datasets

2. **Data Skew**:
   - Inspect the Spark UI for task skew
   - Use appropriate partitioning strategies to balance data
   - Implement salting for join operations on skewed keys

3. **Code Optimization**:
   - Review and optimize transformations (prefer narrow over wide)
   - Tune caching strategies for frequently accessed DataFrames
   - Use appropriate file formats (Parquet, Delta) and compression

## Delta Lake Issues

### Delta Lake Transaction Conflicts

**Symptoms**: Transaction conflicts when multiple writers update the same Delta table.

**Possible Causes and Solutions**:

1. **Concurrent Writers**:
   - Implement optimistic concurrency control with retry logic
   - Consider using Delta Lake's optimistic concurrency control features
   - Schedule jobs to avoid concurrent writes to the same table

2. **Long-Running Transactions**:
   - Break down large operations into smaller batches
   - Avoid holding open transactions for extended periods

### Missing Delta Table History

**Symptoms**: Unable to access previous versions of Delta tables.

**Possible Causes and Solutions**:

1. **Vacuum Operations**:
   - Check if aggressive VACUUM commands have removed needed history
   - Adjust retention period in VACUUM commands
   - Use time travel only within the configured retention window

## Serverless SQL Pool Issues

### Cannot Query Delta Tables Directly

**Symptoms**: Error when trying to query Delta tables directly from Serverless SQL.

**Solution**:
Use the OPENROWSET function with the Parquet format, pointing to the Delta table's location, and include the latest file version:

```sql
SELECT TOP 100 *
FROM OPENROWSET(
    BULK 'https://youraccount.dfs.core.windows.net/container/table/_delta_log/*.json',
    FORMAT = 'CSV',
    FIELDTERMINATOR = '|',
    FIELDQUOTE = '',
    ROWTERMINATOR = '0x0b'
) WITH (json_content VARCHAR(8000)) AS [rows]
CROSS APPLY OPENJSON(json_content)
WITH (
    add BIT '$.add',
    path VARCHAR(400) '$.path'
)
WHERE add = 1;
```

## Metadata and Catalog Issues

### Tables Created in Spark Not Visible in SQL

**Symptoms**: Tables created in Spark notebooks don't appear in Serverless SQL.

**Possible Causes and Solutions**:

1. **Metadata Sync Issues**:
   - Ensure tables are created in the proper database/schema
   - Verify the table is registered in the metastore
   - Check for name conflicts or case sensitivity issues

2. **Permissions Problems**:
   - Confirm the SQL user has proper permissions to the storage location
   - Verify storage access using SAS token or managed identity

## Pipeline and Integration Issues

### Pipeline Failures with Integration Datasets

**Symptoms**: Integration pipelines fail when connecting to external sources.

**Possible Causes and Solutions**:

1. **Connectivity Issues**:
   - Check if the linked service configuration is correct
   - Verify network connectivity to external sources
   - Confirm firewall rules allow connections from Azure

2. **Authentication Problems**:
   - Verify credentials in linked services
   - Check for expired secrets or certificates
   - Test connections independently of the pipeline
