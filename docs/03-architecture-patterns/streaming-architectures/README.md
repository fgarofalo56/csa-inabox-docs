## Overview

Streaming architectures enable organizations to process and analyze data in real-time, providing immediate insights and enabling event-driven decision making. This section covers four fundamental streaming patterns, each optimized for different use cases and organizational requirements.

### Why Streaming Architectures?

Modern enterprises require real-time insights to:

- Detect fraud and security threats immediately
- Monitor IoT devices and respond to anomalies
- Provide personalized customer experiences
- Enable real-time operational dashboards
- Process high-velocity event streams
- Maintain audit trails with complete event history

![Command-Query](https://img.shields.io/badge/Type-Command%20Query-purple?style=flat-square)
![Complexity](https://img.shields.io/badge/Complexity-Advanced-red?style=flat-square)

**Command Query Responsibility Segregation - separate read and write data models.**

**Key Components:**
- **Command Side**: Optimized for write operations and business logic
- **Query Side**: Optimized for read operations and reporting
- **Event Bus**: Synchronizes changes between command and query sides
- **Read Models**: Denormalized views for efficient queries

**When to Use:**

## Pattern Selection Guide

### By Business Requirements

#### Real-time Analytics with Historical Context
**Recommended: Lambda Architecture**

```mermaid
graph LR
    Req[Requirement] --> Lambda
    Lambda --> Batch[Batch Layer<br/>Historical Analytics]
    Lambda --> Speed[Speed Layer<br/>Real-time Metrics]
    Batch --> Serve[Unified Serving]
    Speed --> Serve
```

**Use When:**
- Dashboards need both real-time and historical data
- Complex batch computations (ML models, aggregations)
- Different SLAs for real-time vs batch queries

---

#### Pure Stream Processing
**Recommended: Kappa Architecture**

```mermaid
graph LR
    Req[Requirement] --> Kappa
    Kappa --> Stream[Stream Processing<br/>Only]
    Stream --> Views[Materialized Views]
    Views --> Query[Queryable State]
```

**Use When:**
- All processing is stream-compatible
- Simplicity is priority
- Want to avoid maintaining dual systems
- Replay capability needed

---

#### Complete Audit Trail
**Recommended: Event Sourcing**

```mermaid
graph LR
    Req[Requirement] --> ES[Event Sourcing]
    ES --> Events[Immutable Events]
    Events --> State[Current State]
    Events --> History[Historical State]
    Events --> Audit[Audit Trail]
```

**Use When:**
- Regulatory compliance requires complete history
- Need temporal queries (state at point in time)
- Event-driven microservices
- Complex state transitions

---

#### Performance Optimization
**Recommended: CQRS**

```mermaid
graph LR
    Req[Requirement] --> CQRS
    CQRS --> Write[Write Model<br/>Optimized]
    CQRS --> Read[Read Model<br/>Optimized]
    Write -->|Event Bus| Read
```

**Use When:**
- Read/write patterns very different
- High query performance critical
- Complex business logic on writes
- Independent scaling needed

---

## Implementation Patterns

### Combining Patterns

Patterns can be combined for enhanced capabilities:

#### Event Sourcing + CQRS

```mermaid
graph TB
    subgraph "Write Side"
        Cmd[Commands] --> Val[Validation]
        Val --> ES[Event Store]
    end

    subgraph "Event Bus"
        ES --> EB[Event Stream]
    end

    subgraph "Read Side"
        EB --> P1[Projector 1]
        EB --> P2[Projector 2]
        P1 --> RM1[Read Model 1]
        P2 --> RM2[Read Model 2]
    end

    RM1 --> Q[Queries]
    RM2 --> Q
```

**Benefits:**
- Complete audit trail from Event Sourcing
- Optimized read models from CQRS
- Independent scaling of read/write
- Multiple specialized read models

**Challenges:**
- Highest complexity of any combination
- Eventually consistent reads
- Operational overhead

---

#### Lambda + CQRS

```mermaid
graph TB
    subgraph "Ingestion"
        Data[Data Sources] --> EH[Event Hubs]
    end

    subgraph "Lambda Processing"
        EH --> Batch[Batch Layer]
        EH --> Speed[Speed Layer]
    end

    subgraph "CQRS Serving"
        Batch --> Write[Write Store]
        Speed --> Write
        Write --> Sync[Synchronization]
        Sync --> Read[Read Store]
    end
```

**Benefits:**
- Real-time and batch processing
- Optimized query performance
- Separation of concerns

**Challenges:**
- Complex architecture
- Multiple sync points
- Operational complexity

---

## Performance Considerations

### Latency Requirements

| Pattern | Typical Latency | Throughput | Best For |
|---------|----------------|------------|----------|
| Lambda Speed | < 100ms | Very High | Real-time alerts |
| Lambda Batch | Minutes-Hours | Extremely High | Historical analysis |
| Kappa | < 1s | High | Near real-time |
| Event Sourcing | < 10ms | Medium-High | Transaction processing |
| CQRS Writes | < 10ms | Medium-High | Transactional |
| CQRS Reads | < 100ms | Very High | Analytics queries |

### Scalability Patterns

#### Horizontal Scaling

```mermaid
graph LR
    subgraph "Partitioned Event Stream"
        P1[Partition 1] --> C1[Consumer 1]
        P2[Partition 2] --> C2[Consumer 2]
        P3[Partition 3] --> C3[Consumer 3]
        PN[Partition N] --> CN[Consumer N]
    end
```

**Best Practices:**
- Use Event Hubs partitions for parallelism
- Partition by key for related events
- Scale consumers to match partitions
- Monitor partition lag

#### Vertical Scaling

```mermaid
graph TB
    Small[Small Instance] -->|Upgrade| Medium[Medium Instance]
    Medium -->|Upgrade| Large[Large Instance]
    Large -->|Upgrade| XLarge[XLarge Instance]
```

**Best Practices:**
- Start small, measure, then scale
- Use auto-scaling for variable workloads
- Consider cost vs performance tradeoffs

## Cost Optimization

### Cost Drivers by Pattern

| Pattern | Primary Costs | Optimization Strategies |
|---------|--------------|------------------------|
| **Lambda** | Compute (2 systems), Storage | Auto-pause Spark, optimize batch schedules |
| **Kappa** | Streaming compute, Event Hub | Right-size throughput units, retention |
| **Event Sourcing** | Storage (events), Cosmos DB | Event archival, compact snapshots |
| **CQRS** | Dual storage, Sync overhead | Selective projections, eventual consistency |

### Cost Optimization Strategies

#### Event Hubs Optimization

```python
# Configure appropriate retention and throughput
event_hub_config = {
    "partition_count": 4,  # Match expected parallelism
    "message_retention_days": 1,  # Minimize unless replay needed
    "throughput_units": 2,  # Auto-inflate for spikes
    "enable_auto_inflate": True,
    "maximum_throughput_units": 10
}
```

#### Spark Pool Optimization

```python
# Configure auto-pause and right-size nodes
spark_pool_config = {
    "node_size": "Medium",  # Start small
    "min_nodes": 3,
    "max_nodes": 10,
    "auto_pause_minutes": 15,  # Pause when idle
    "auto_scale_enabled": True
}
```

#### Cosmos DB Optimization

```python
# Use appropriate consistency and TTL
cosmos_config = {
    "consistency_level": "Session",  # Balance performance/cost
    "time_to_live": 86400 * 30,  # 30 days, not forever
    "indexing_mode": "Lazy",  # For write-heavy workloads
    "partition_key": "/deviceId"  # Distribute load
}
```

## Security Patterns

### Authentication & Authorization

```mermaid
graph TB
    Client[Client App] --> AAD[Azure AD]
    AAD --> Token[Access Token]

    Token --> EH[Event Hubs]
    Token --> SA[Stream Analytics]
    Token --> DB[Cosmos DB]

    subgraph "RBAC Policies"
        EH --> RBAC1[Event Sender]
        SA --> RBAC2[Contributor]
        DB --> RBAC3[Data Reader/Writer]
    end
```

### Data Protection

| Pattern | Encryption at Rest | Encryption in Transit | Key Management |
|---------|-------------------|----------------------|----------------|
| All | Azure Storage Service Encryption | TLS 1.2+ | Azure Key Vault |
| Event Sourcing | Cosmos DB encryption | HTTPS only | Customer-managed keys |
| CQRS | Multi-store encryption | Private endpoints | Separate keys per store |

### Network Security

```mermaid
graph TB
    subgraph "Public Internet"
        Client[External Clients]
    end

    subgraph "Azure Virtual Network"
        subgraph "Ingestion Subnet"
            PE1[Private Endpoint] --> EH[Event Hubs]
        end

        subgraph "Processing Subnet"
            EH --> SA[Stream Analytics]
            SA --> Spark[Synapse Spark]
        end

        subgraph "Storage Subnet"
            Spark --> PE2[Private Endpoint]
            PE2 --> DL[Data Lake]
        end
    end

    Client -->|VPN/ExpressRoute| PE1
