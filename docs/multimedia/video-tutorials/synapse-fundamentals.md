"Notice the Spark pool is starting up. This takes about 2-3 minutes the first time, but subsequent sessions start much faster."

**[TYPE IN FIRST CELL]**:
```python
# Cell 1: Load data
from pyspark.sql.functions import *

# Read sales data
sales_df = spark.read.parquet("abfss://data@contosolake.dfs.core.windows.net/sales/2024/")

# Show schema
sales_df.printSchema()

# Display first 10 rows
display(sales_df.limit(10))
```

**[RUN CELL]**

**NARRATOR**:
"Great! Now let's perform some transformations."

**[TYPE IN SECOND CELL]**:
```python
# Cell 2: Transform and analyze
# Calculate daily sales trends
daily_sales = sales_df \
    .withColumn("sale_date", to_date(col("timestamp"))) \
    .groupBy("sale_date", "product_category") \
    .agg(
        sum("sales_amount").alias("total_sales"),
        count("*").alias("transaction_count"),
        avg("sales_amount").alias("avg_transaction")
    ) \
    .orderBy("sale_date", col("total_sales").desc())

# Display results
display(daily_sales)
```

**[RUN CELL]**

**NARRATOR**:
"Excellent! We can see the daily sales trends broken down by product category. Now let's save this transformed data."

**[TYPE IN THIRD CELL]**:
```python
# Cell 3: Save transformed data
# Write to Delta Lake format
daily_sales.write \
    .format("delta") \
    .mode("overwrite") \
    .save("abfss://processed@contosolake.dfs.core.windows.net/daily_sales/")

print("Data successfully written to Delta Lake!")
```

**[RUN CELL]**

#### Step 3: Create External Table (20:00 - 21:00)

**[VISUAL: Switch back to SQL script]**

**NARRATOR**:
"Now that we've saved the transformed data, let's create an external table so we can query it with SQL."

**[TYPE OUT SQL]**:
```sql
-- Create external data source
CREATE EXTERNAL DATA SOURCE processed_data
WITH (
    LOCATION = 'abfss://processed@contosolake.dfs.core.windows.net/'
);

-- Create external table
CREATE EXTERNAL TABLE daily_sales (
    sale_date DATE,
    product_category VARCHAR(100),
    total_sales DECIMAL(18,2),
    transaction_count INT,
    avg_transaction DECIMAL(18,2)
)
WITH (
    LOCATION = 'daily_sales/',
    DATA_SOURCE = processed_data,
    FILE_FORMAT = DeltaFormat
);

-- Query the table
SELECT * FROM daily_sales
ORDER BY sale_date DESC, total_sales DESC;
```

**[RUN QUERY]**

**NARRATOR**:
"Perfect! Now anyone with SQL knowledge can query this transformed data without needing to use Spark."
