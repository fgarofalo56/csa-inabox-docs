## Common Questions

### How long does it take to produce a 15-minute tutorial?

**Typical Timeline:**
- Planning & scripting: 3-4 hours
- Recording: 2-3 hours
- Post-production: 4-6 hours
- Accessibility (captions, etc.): 1-2 hours
- **Total: 10-15 hours**

See [Production Best Practices](./production-best-practices.md#recording-workflow) for detailed breakdown.

### What's the minimum budget to get started?

**Starter Package: ~$500**
- USB microphone: $130
- Headphones: $100
- Software: Free (OBS, DaVinci Resolve)
- Basic lighting: $50
- Acoustic treatment: $120

See [Equipment Requirements](./equipment.md#budget-recommendations) for complete packages.

### What are the essential accessibility requirements?

**Must-Haves:**
- Accurate closed captions (synchronized within 200ms)
- Complete text transcript
- Color contrast ratio of 4.5:1 minimum
- Keyboard-accessible video controls

See [Accessibility Guidelines](./accessibility.md#wcag-21-compliance) for full requirements.

### Can I use AI tools for captions and scripts?

**Yes, with caveats:**
- **Captions**: AI auto-captions are a good starting point but require manual editing for accuracy
- **Scripts**: AI can help with outlines and drafts, but human review is essential for quality
- **Transcripts**: AI transcription works well for clear audio, less so for technical jargon

See relevant sections in [Accessibility Guidelines](./accessibility.md#caption-services) and [Script Writing](./script-writing.md#script-development).
