### Opening Hook (0:00 - 0:45)

**[SCENE 1: Dynamic Animation - Real-Time Data Flow]**
**[Background: Dark theme with flowing data streams]**

**NARRATOR**:
"Your customers are generating data right now. IoT sensors are recording measurements this very second. Transactions are happening as we speak. But by the time traditional batch processing gets to that data, the moment is gone. The opportunity is lost."

**[VISUAL: Split screen showing]**
- Left: Batch processing (data aging, delayed insights)
- Right: Stream processing (real-time insights, immediate action)

**NARRATOR**:
"Welcome to Azure Stream Analytics - Microsoft's real-time analytics service that processes millions of events per second with sub-second latency. In the next 28 minutes, you'll learn how to transform streaming data into actionable insights instantly."

### Introduction & Real-Time Concepts (0:45 - 4:00)

**[SCENE 2: Conceptual Overview]**

**NARRATOR**:
"Before we dive into the technical details, let's understand what stream processing really means and why it matters."

**[VISUAL: Animated comparison diagram]**

#### Batch vs Stream Processing

**NARRATOR**:
"Traditional batch processing collects data over time, then processes it in large chunks. Stream processing analyzes each event as it arrives."

**Key Differences**:

| Aspect | Batch Processing | Stream Processing |
|--------|-----------------|-------------------|
| Latency | Hours to days | Milliseconds to seconds |
| Data Volume | Large batches | Continuous micro-batches |
| Use Case | Historical analysis | Real-time decisions |
| Complexity | Simpler | More complex |

#### Real-Time Use Cases

**[VISUAL: Use case carousel with animations]**

**NARRATOR**:
"Stream processing excels in scenarios requiring immediate action:"

**Use Cases**:
1. **Fraud Detection**: Analyze transactions in real-time, flag suspicious activity instantly
2. **IoT Monitoring**: Monitor sensor data, alert on anomalies immediately
3. **Website Analytics**: Track user behavior, personalize content dynamically
4. **Supply Chain**: Monitor shipments, predict delays proactively
5. **Trading Systems**: Process market data, execute trades in microseconds

**[VISUAL: Azure Stream Analytics architecture]**

**NARRATOR**:
"Azure Stream Analytics sits between your streaming sources and destination systems, processing data in motion with a simple SQL-like query language."

**Architecture Components**:
- **Inputs**: Event Hubs, IoT Hub, Blob Storage
- **Query**: SQL-like transformation logic
- **Outputs**: SQL Database, Cosmos DB, Power BI, Data Lake
- **Compute**: Fully managed, auto-scaling

**[TRANSITION: Fade to Azure Portal]**

### Section 1: Creating Your First Streaming Job (4:00 - 9:00)

**[SCENE 3: Azure Portal Walkthrough]**

**NARRATOR**:
"Let's create a Stream Analytics job that processes IoT sensor data in real-time."

#### Job Creation (4:00 - 5:30)

**[VISUAL: Navigate to Create Resource > Stream Analytics Job]**

**NARRATOR**:
"Creating a Stream Analytics job is straightforward. Let me walk you through it."

**Configuration**:
```json
{
  "name": "iot-sensor-analytics",
  "resourceGroup": "streaming-rg",
  "location": "East US",
  "streamingUnits": 3,
  "hostingEnvironment": "Cloud"
}
```

**Key Decisions**:
- **Streaming Units (SUs)**: Compute capacity (1-396 SUs)
  - 1 SU: ~1 MB/s throughput
  - 3 SUs: Good starting point
  - Scale up based on actual load
- **Region**: Choose closest to data source
- **Compatibility Level**: Use latest (1.2) for new features

**[VISUAL: Click Create, wait for deployment]**

#### Configuring Inputs (5:30 - 7:00)

**NARRATOR**:
"Now let's connect our job to an Event Hub that's receiving IoT sensor data."

**[VISUAL: Navigate to Inputs > Add Stream Input > Event Hub]**

**Input Configuration**:
```json
{
  "inputAlias": "sensor-input",
  "sourceType": "Event Hub",
  "eventHubNamespace": "iot-sensors-ns",
  "eventHubName": "sensor-data",
  "consumerGroup": "$Default",
  "authenticationMode": "Managed Identity",
  "serialization": {
    "type": "JSON",
    "encoding": "UTF8"
  }
}
```

**Sample Input Data**:
```json
{
  "deviceId": "sensor-001",
  "temperature": 72.5,
  "humidity": 45.3,
  "pressure": 1013.2,
  "timestamp": "2024-01-15T10:30:45Z",
  "location": "Building-A-Floor-2"
}
```

**[VISUAL: Test connection, show sample data preview]**

**NARRATOR**:
"The sample data feature lets us see actual events from our Event Hub. This is crucial for developing and testing queries."

#### Configuring Outputs (7:00 - 9:00)

**NARRATOR**:
"Stream Analytics can send results to multiple destinations simultaneously. Let's configure two outputs: one for Power BI dashboards and one for long-term storage."

**[VISUAL: Add Output > Power BI]**

**Power BI Output**:
```json
{
  "outputAlias": "powerbi-dashboard",
  "sink": "Power BI",
  "workspace": "Real-Time Analytics",
  "dataset": "Sensor Metrics",
  "table": "Live Readings",
  "authenticationMode": "User Token"
}
```

**[VISUAL: Add Output > Data Lake Storage]**

**Data Lake Output**:
```json
{
  "outputAlias": "datalake-archive",
  "sink": "Azure Data Lake Gen2",
  "accountName": "analyticsstorage",
  "container": "sensor-archive",
  "pathPattern": "sensors/{date}/{time}",
  "serialization": {
    "type": "Parquet"
  }
}
```

**Benefits of Multiple Outputs**:
- Real-time dashboards + historical storage
- Hot path (Power BI) + cold path (Data Lake)
- Different consumers for different needs

**[TRANSITION: Navigate to Query editor]**

### Section 2: Stream Analytics Query Language (9:00 - 16:30)

**[SCENE 4: Query Editor Focus]**

**NARRATOR**:
"Stream Analytics uses a SQL-like query language that's familiar yet powerful. Let's start simple and build up to complex scenarios."

#### Basic Query Structure (9:00 - 10:30)

**NARRATOR**:
"Here's the simplest possible query - pass through all events unchanged."

**Pass-Through Query**:
```sql
SELECT
    *
INTO
    [datalake-archive]
FROM
    [sensor-input]
```

**NARRATOR**:
"But we rarely want everything unchanged. Let's add some filtering and transformation."

**Basic Transformation**:
```sql
SELECT
    deviceId,
    temperature,
    humidity,
    pressure,
    System.Timestamp() AS ProcessedTime,
    CASE
        WHEN temperature > 80 THEN 'High'
        WHEN temperature < 60 THEN 'Low'
        ELSE 'Normal'
    END AS TemperatureStatus
INTO
    [powerbi-dashboard]
FROM
    [sensor-input]
WHERE
    temperature IS NOT NULL
```

**Key Concepts**:
- `System.Timestamp()`: Event timestamp
- Standard SQL functions (CASE, WHERE, etc.)
- Column transformation and renaming

#### Time Windowing Functions (10:30 - 13:30)

**NARRATOR**:
"The real power of stream processing comes from windowing functions. These let you aggregate data over time windows."

**[VISUAL: Animated diagram showing different window types]**

##### Tumbling Window

**NARRATOR**:
"Tumbling windows are fixed-size, non-overlapping time segments."

**[VISUAL: Timeline showing 5-minute tumbling windows]**

**Query Example**:
```sql
SELECT
    deviceId,
    AVG(temperature) AS avg_temp,
    MAX(temperature) AS max_temp,
    MIN(temperature) AS min_temp,
    COUNT(*) AS reading_count,
    System.Timestamp() AS WindowEnd
INTO
    [powerbi-dashboard]
FROM
    [sensor-input]
GROUP BY
    deviceId,
    TumblingWindow(minute, 5)
```

**NARRATOR**:
"This query calculates 5-minute averages for each device. Every 5 minutes, you get aggregated metrics."

**Use Cases**:
- Hourly sales totals
- Daily active users
- Per-minute transaction counts

##### Hopping Window

**NARRATOR**:
"Hopping windows are fixed-size but can overlap."

**[VISUAL: Timeline showing overlapping 10-minute windows every 5 minutes]**

**Query Example**:
```sql
SELECT
    location,
    AVG(temperature) AS avg_temp,
    System.Timestamp() AS WindowEnd
INTO
    [powerbi-dashboard]
FROM
    [sensor-input]
GROUP BY
    location,
    HoppingWindow(minute, 10, 5)
```

**NARRATOR**:
"This creates a 10-minute window that hops forward every 5 minutes. You get more frequent updates with some historical context."

##### Sliding Window

**NARRATOR**:
"Sliding windows are continuous - they produce output only when events occur."

**Query Example**:
```sql
SELECT
    deviceId,
    COUNT(*) AS event_count,
    System.Timestamp() AS WindowEnd
INTO
    [alert-output]
FROM
    [sensor-input]
GROUP BY
    deviceId,
    SlidingWindow(minute, 5)
HAVING
    COUNT(*) > 100
```

**NARRATOR**:
"This detects devices sending more than 100 events in any 5-minute period - perfect for anomaly detection."

##### Session Window

**NARRATOR**:
"Session windows adapt to data patterns, grouping events that occur close together."

**Query Example**:
```sql
SELECT
    deviceId,
    MIN(timestamp) AS session_start,
    MAX(timestamp) AS session_end,
    COUNT(*) AS events_in_session
INTO
    [session-analysis]
FROM
    [sensor-input]
GROUP BY
    deviceId,
    SessionWindow(minute, 5, 60)
```

**NARRATOR**:
"Sessions group events with gaps no larger than 5 minutes, with a maximum session length of 60 minutes."

#### Advanced Query Patterns (13:30 - 16:30)

##### JOIN Operations

**NARRATOR**:
"You can join streaming data with reference data or even other streams."

**[VISUAL: Show two input streams]**

**Stream-to-Reference JOIN**:
```sql
-- Reference data: device metadata
SELECT
    s.deviceId,
    s.temperature,
    r.location,
    r.building,
    r.floor,
    r.department
INTO
    [enriched-output]
FROM
    [sensor-input] s
JOIN
    [device-reference] r
ON
    s.deviceId = r.deviceId
```

**Stream-to-Stream JOIN**:
```sql
-- Correlate temperature and humidity from different sensors
SELECT
    t.location,
    t.temperature,
    h.humidity,
    System.Timestamp() AS reading_time
INTO
    [combined-metrics]
FROM
    [temperature-stream] t TIMESTAMP BY temp_time
JOIN
    [humidity-stream] h TIMESTAMP BY humid_time
ON
    t.location = h.location
    AND DATEDIFF(second, t, h) BETWEEN 0 AND 10
```

##### Anomaly Detection

**NARRATOR**:
"Stream Analytics has built-in machine learning for anomaly detection."

**Anomaly Detection Query**:
```sql
WITH AnomalyDetectionStep AS
(
    SELECT
        deviceId,
        temperature,
        AnomalyDetection_SpikeAndDip(temperature, 95, 120, 'spikesanddips')
            OVER(LIMIT DURATION(minute, 5)) AS scores
    FROM
        [sensor-input]
)
SELECT
    deviceId,
    temperature,
    CAST(GetRecordPropertyValue(scores, 'Score') AS FLOAT) AS anomaly_score,
    CAST(GetRecordPropertyValue(scores, 'IsAnomaly') AS BIGINT) AS is_anomaly
INTO
    [anomaly-alerts]
FROM
    AnomalyDetectionStep
WHERE
    CAST(GetRecordPropertyValue(scores, 'IsAnomaly') AS BIGINT) = 1
```

**NARRATOR**:
"This detects sudden spikes or dips in temperature readings with 95% confidence over a 2-hour learning period."

##### Complex Event Processing

**NARRATOR**:
"You can detect complex patterns across multiple events."

**Pattern Detection**:
```sql
-- Detect when temperature rises consistently over 3 consecutive readings
SELECT
    deviceId,
    reading1.temperature AS temp1,
    reading2.temperature AS temp2,
    reading3.temperature AS temp3,
    System.Timestamp() AS alert_time
INTO
    [pattern-alerts]
FROM
    [sensor-input] reading1
    INNER JOIN [sensor-input] reading2
        ON DATEDIFF(second, reading1, reading2) BETWEEN 1 AND 5
        AND reading1.deviceId = reading2.deviceId
        AND reading2.temperature > reading1.temperature
    INNER JOIN [sensor-input] reading3
        ON DATEDIFF(second, reading2, reading3) BETWEEN 1 AND 5
        AND reading2.deviceId = reading3.deviceId
        AND reading3.temperature > reading2.temperature
```

}
```

#### Troubleshooting Common Issues (23:30 - 25:00)

**NARRATOR**:
"Let's look at common issues and how to resolve them."

**[VISUAL: Diagnostic logs]**

##### Issue 1: High Watermark Delay

**Symptoms**:
- Watermark delay increasing over time
- Events being processed late

**Solutions**:
```sql
-- Check query complexity
-- Solution 1: Increase streaming units
-- Solution 2: Optimize query (reduce JOINs)
-- Solution 3: Partition input data
```

##### Issue 2: Data Quality Errors

**NARRATOR**:
"Sometimes input data doesn't match expected schema."

**Error Example**:
```
Error: Cannot convert value "N/A" to Float for column "temperature"
```

**Solution Query**:
```sql
SELECT
    deviceId,
    TRY_CAST(temperature AS FLOAT) AS temperature,
    CASE
        WHEN TRY_CAST(temperature AS FLOAT) IS NULL
        THEN 'Invalid'
        ELSE 'Valid'
    END AS data_quality
INTO
    [output]
FROM
    [input]
```

##### Issue 3: Output Throttling

**NARRATOR**:
"Your output sink might not be able to keep up with the event rate."

**Solutions**:
- Increase output sink capacity (e.g., SQL DTUs)
- Batch output writes
- Use multiple output sinks for load distribution

#### Scaling Considerations (25:00 - 25:30)

**[VISUAL: Scaling configuration panel]**

**NARRATOR**:
"Stream Analytics scales linearly with streaming units."

**Scaling Guide**:
```
1-3 SUs: Testing and development (up to 1 MB/s)
6-12 SUs: Small production workloads (up to 5 MB/s)
12-60 SUs: Medium workloads (up to 25 MB/s)
60+ SUs: Large scale enterprise (> 25 MB/s)
```

**Cost Considerations**:
- 1 SU = ~$0.11/hour
