## 🏠 Room Setup & Acoustic Treatment

### Room Selection

```markdown
## Choosing the Right Space

### Ideal Room Characteristics

**Size**: 10' x 12' minimum, 12' x 15' ideal
**Shape**: Irregular better than perfect square
**Ceiling Height**: 8-10 feet
**Windows**: Minimal (or with heavy curtains)
**HVAC**: Quiet system or ability to turn off
**Traffic**: Low foot traffic area
**Flooring**: Carpet preferred (or rugs on hard floors)

### Rooms to Avoid

❌ Bathrooms (too much reflection)
❌ Kitchens (appliance noise)
❌ Rooms with large windows (external noise)
❌ Perfect cubes (standing wave issues)
❌ Rooms with HVAC vents directly overhead
❌ Basements with active utilities nearby

### Temporary Spaces

For recording without dedicated room:
- **Closet**: Excellent sound isolation, clothes absorb sound
- **Under blanket fort**: DIY vocal booth
- **Car**: Surprisingly good isolation (parked, engine off)
- **Portable vocal booth**: Reflection filters
```

### Acoustic Treatment Basics

```markdown
## Sound Treatment Principles

### The Four Types of Treatment

**1. Absorption** (Foam Panels, Fiberglass)
- **Purpose**: Reduce reflections
- **Placement**: First reflection points, corners
- **Coverage**: 20-30% of wall surface
- **DIY Option**: Moving blankets, thick curtains

**2. Diffusion** (Diffuser Panels)
- **Purpose**: Scatter sound evenly
- **Placement**: Rear wall, ceiling
- **Coverage**: 10-15% of surface
- **DIY Option**: Bookshelves with varied depths

**3. Bass Traps** (Corner Bass Traps)
- **Purpose**: Control low-frequency buildup
- **Placement**: Room corners (floor and ceiling)
- **Coverage**: All corners ideally
- **DIY Option**: Stacked fiberglass insulation in corners

**4. Isolation** (Mass-Loaded Vinyl, Decoupling)
- **Purpose**: Prevent sound transmission
- **Placement**: Walls, floors, ceilings
- **Coverage**: As needed for isolation
- **DIY Option**: Heavy curtains, door sweeps

### Treatment Priority

**Priority 1** (Most Important):
- Corner bass traps (4-8 units)
- First reflection points (4-6 panels)
- Behind microphone position (2-4 panels)

**Priority 2**:
- Additional wall absorption
- Ceiling treatment
- Rear wall diffusion

**Priority 3**:
- Fine-tuning with measurements
- Additional diffusion
- Advanced isolation

### DIY Treatment Solutions

**Budget Acoustic Panels**:
Materials (per 2'x4' panel):
- Owens Corning 703 fiberglass: $12
- Fabric covering: $5
- Wood frame (1x4 lumber): $8
- Total per panel: ~$25

**Installation**:
- Measure and mark wall positions
- Use command strips or Z-clips
- Focus on first reflection points
- Add corner bass traps first
```

## 🎛️ Equipment Setup & Configuration

### Microphone Positioning

```markdown
## Proper Mic Placement

### Distance from Mouth

**Standard Position**: 6-8 inches
- Reduces proximity effect
- Captures natural tone
- Room for hand gestures

**Close Mic** (3-4 inches):
- More intimate sound
- Reduces room noise
- Increases plosive risk
- Requires pop filter

**Far Mic** (10-12 inches):
- More room ambience
- Reduces plosive issues
- Requires quieter environment

### Angle & Orientation

**Straight-On** (Most Common):
- Mic diaphragm facing mouth
- Pop filter essential
- Best frequency response

**Off-Axis** (30-45 degrees):
- Reduces plosives naturally
- Slightly changes tone
- Good for some voices

**Height**:
- Mic capsule at mouth level
- Or slightly above, angled down
- Maintains consistent distance
```

### Signal Chain Setup

```markdown
## Connecting Your Equipment

### Basic USB Microphone Chain

```
Microphone (USB) → Computer USB Port → Recording Software
                  ↓
              Headphones (plugged into mic or computer)
```

**Setup Steps**:
1. Connect USB mic to computer
2. Select mic as input in OS audio settings
3. Plug headphones into mic's headphone jack
4. Adjust mic gain (50-75% to start)
5. Set headphone volume comfortably
6. Open recording software and test

### Professional XLR Chain

```
Microphone → [Cloudlifter] → Audio Interface → Computer
                                   ↓
                              Headphones
```

**Setup Steps**:
1. Connect mic XLR to Cloudlifter input (if using)
2. Connect Cloudlifter output to interface input
3. Connect interface to computer via USB
4. Plug headphones into interface headphone jack
5. Set interface gain (varies by mic)
6. Enable 48V phantom power (for condenser mics ONLY)
7. Adjust headphone mix and volume
8. Open DAW and configure input

### Level Setting

**Target Levels**:
- **Peak**: -12 to -6 dBFS (leaves headroom)
- **Average**: -18 to -12 dBFS
- **Noise Floor**: Below -60 dBFS

**How to Set Levels**:
1. Speak at normal recording volume
2. Adjust gain so peaks hit -10 to -6 dBFS
3. Louder passages should not clip (hit 0 dBFS)
4. If clipping occurs, reduce gain
5. Better to record quieter and boost later

**Level Check**:
Record 30 seconds of test audio, including:
- Normal speaking
- Louder emphasis
- Quiet speaking
- Silence (check noise floor)
```

❌ Let phone vibrate on desk
```

## 🎧 Monitoring Best Practices

### Headphone Usage

```markdown
## Proper Monitoring Technique

### Volume Levels

**Recording**:
- Moderate volume (can hear clearly but not loud)
- Should still hear room sounds
- Prevents ear fatigue

**Editing**:
- Vary levels during editing
- Check at multiple volumes
- Use reference tracks

**Mixing**:
- Start at moderate level
- Periodically lower volume
- Check at anticipated listening levels

### Open-Back vs Closed-Back

**Closed-Back** (Recording):
- Isolates sound
- Prevents mic bleed
- Required for recording

**Open-Back** (Editing/Mixing):
- Natural sound
- Less ear fatigue
- Better for critical listening
- NOT for recording (leaks sound)

### Monitoring Mix

**Solo Recording**:
- 100% input monitoring
- Hear yourself in real-time
- Add light reverb for comfort (optional)

**Multi-Person Recording**:
- Balanced mix of all mics
- Your voice slightly louder for comfort
- Monitor overall balance
