1. Start the Migration Assessment Wizard
2. On the **"Discovery"** tab, select your current platform:
   - Source Platform: **"On-premises SQL Server"**
   - Version: **"SQL Server 2016"**
   - Edition: **"Enterprise"**
3. Enter infrastructure details:
   - Server Count: **3**
   - Total Cores: **96**
   - Total RAM: **768 GB**
   - Total Storage: **50 TB**

**Expected Outcome**: System captures baseline configuration

#### Step 2: Database Inventory

1. Click **"Add Database"** for each database to migrate:

**Database 1: Sales_DW**
- Size: 15 TB
- Tables: 450
- Views: 125
- Stored Procedures: 850
- Functions: 200
- Jobs: 35

**Database 2: Marketing_Analytics**
- Size: 8 TB
- Tables: 220
- Views: 75
- Stored Procedures: 420
- Functions: 95
- Jobs: 18

2. Upload database schema (optional):
   ```sql
   -- Upload schema export or paste DDL
   -- Wizard will parse and analyze automatically
   ```

**Expected Outcome**: Complete inventory of database objects

#### Step 3: Workload Characterization

1. Navigate to **"Workload Profile"** section
2. For each database, characterize workloads:

**Sales_DW Workload**:
- Query Types: 60% reporting, 30% batch, 10% real-time
- Concurrent Users: 150
- Peak Hours: 8 AM - 6 PM weekdays
- Query Complexity: High
- Update Frequency: Hourly
- Critical Business Function: Yes

3. Add sample queries (optional):
   ```sql
   -- Example query 1: Daily sales report
   SELECT
       d.date,
       p.product_name,
       SUM(f.sales_amount) as total_sales
   FROM fact_sales f
   JOIN dim_date d ON f.date_key = d.date_key
   JOIN dim_product p ON f.product_key = p.product_key
   WHERE d.date >= DATEADD(day, -30, GETDATE())
   GROUP BY d.date, p.product_name
   ORDER BY d.date DESC;
   ```

**Expected Outcome**: System categorizes workload patterns

#### Step 4: Dependencies and Integration

1. Map external dependencies:
   - **ETL Tools**: SSIS, Informatica
   - **BI Tools**: Power BI, Tableau
   - **Applications**: 12 custom applications
   - **Data Sources**: 8 source systems
   - **Data Consumers**: 25 downstream systems

2. Document integration points:
   ```json
   {
     "integrations": [
       {
         "name": "Daily Sales Extract",
         "type": "SSIS Package",
         "frequency": "Daily",
         "criticality": "High",

### Interactive UI

```javascript
// React-based Migration Wizard
import React, { useState } from 'react';
import { useForm } from 'react-hook-form';

const MigrationWizard = () => {
  const [currentStep, setCurrentStep] = useState(1);
  const [assessment, setAssessment] = useState(null);
  const { register, handleSubmit } = useForm();

  const steps = [
    { id: 1, name: 'Discovery', component: DiscoveryStep },
    { id: 2, name: 'Analysis', component: AnalysisStep },
    { id: 3, name: 'Planning', component: PlanningStep },
    { id: 4, name: 'Roadmap', component: RoadmapStep }
  ];

  const onSubmitDiscovery = async (data) => {
    const response = await fetch('/api/migration/assess', {
      method: 'POST',
      headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
      body: JSON.stringify(data)
    });
    const result = await response.json();
    setAssessment(result);
    setCurrentStep(2);
  };

  const CurrentStepComponent = steps[currentStep - 1].component;

  return (
    <div className="migration-wizard">
      <WizardProgress steps={steps} currentStep={currentStep} />
      <CurrentStepComponent
        assessment={assessment}
        onComplete={(data) => handleStepComplete(data)}
      />
      <WizardNavigation
        currentStep={currentStep}
        totalSteps={steps.length}
        onPrevious={() => setCurrentStep(currentStep - 1)}

    </div>
  );
};
```

## ❓ FAQ

**Q: Can this tool assess migrations from other platforms (Oracle, Teradata)?**
A: Yes, the wizard supports multiple source platforms including Oracle, Teradata, Netezza, and Redshift.

**Q: How accurate are the effort estimates?**
A: Estimates are based on industry benchmarks and historical data. Actual effort may vary ±30% depending on specific circumstances.

**Q: Can I save and resume the assessment?**
A: Yes, you can save your progress at any step and resume later. Use the "Save Progress" button.

**Q: Does this generate actual migration scripts?**
A: The wizard generates high-level migration plans. Detailed scripts should be generated using Azure Database Migration Service or custom tools.

**Q: How do I handle sensitive data during assessment?**
A: You can use anonymized metadata for assessment. Full data migration planning can be done without exposing sensitive data.
