      null_count = df.filter(col(column_name).isNull()).count()
      total_count = df.count()
      return {
          "column": column_name,
          "null_count": null_count,
          "total_count": total_count,
          "null_percentage": (null_count / total_count) * 100 if total_count > 0 else 0
