# Cosmos DB Troubleshooting

This section provides troubleshooting guidance for Azure Cosmos DB issues in Cloud Scale Analytics environments.

## Overview

Azure Cosmos DB is a globally distributed, multi-model database service. This guide helps resolve common issues encountered in analytics workloads.

## Common Issues

### Performance

- [Query Performance](query-performance.md) - Slow queries and optimization
- [RU Optimization](ru-optimization.md) - Request Unit consumption issues

### Data Management

- [Partitioning](partitioning.md) - Partition key issues and hot partitions

## Quick Diagnostics

### High RU Consumption

1. Check query patterns for cross-partition queries
2. Review indexing policy
3. Analyze partition key distribution
4. Monitor throughput utilization

### Slow Queries

1. Enable query metrics
2. Check for missing indexes
3. Review partition strategy
4. Optimize query structure
