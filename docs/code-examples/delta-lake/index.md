# Delta Lake Examples for Azure Synapse Analytics

[Home](/) > [Code Examples](/docs/code-examples/index.md) > Delta Lake

This section provides examples and best practices for working with Delta Lake in Azure Synapse Analytics. Delta Lake is an open-source storage layer that brings reliability to data lakes by providing ACID transactions, scalable metadata handling, and unifying streaming and batch data processing.

## Available Examples

### Data Ingestion

- [Auto Loader](ingestion/auto-loader.md) - Efficiently ingest data from files into Delta tables
  - Basic auto loading with schema inference
  - Schema evolution handling
  - Partition management
  - Optimized configurations

### Data Change Management

- [Change Data Capture (CDC)](cdc/change-data-capture.md) - Implement change data capture patterns with Delta Lake
  - Delta Lake Change Data Feed (CDF)
  - Time travel for table comparisons
  - Streaming CDC processing
  - SCD Type 2 implementation
  - CDC from external sources

### Performance Optimization

- [Table Optimization](optimization/table-optimization.md) - Optimize Delta tables for performance
  - OPTIMIZE command usage
  - VACUUM command usage
  - Z-ORDER for data skipping
  - Automated maintenance workflows
  - Partition-aware optimization
  - Monitoring and statistics

## Why Delta Lake in Azure Synapse?

Delta Lake provides several benefits for data lakes in Azure Synapse Analytics:

1. **ACID Transactions**: Ensures data consistency with serializable isolation levels
2. **Schema Enforcement**: Prevents data corruption by validating data against the schema
3. **Schema Evolution**: Adapts to changing data schemas without breaking downstream applications
4. **Time Travel**: Access and restore previous versions of data using snapshots
5. **Audit History**: Track all changes made to tables with complete history
6. **Unified Batch and Streaming**: Process both batch and streaming data in the same architecture

## Delta Lake Architecture in Azure Synapse

Delta Lake in Azure Synapse Analytics typically follows this architecture:

1. **Bronze Layer**: Raw data ingested from various sources
2. **Silver Layer**: Cleansed and conformed data with business keys
3. **Gold Layer**: Aggregated, enriched data optimized for analytics and consumption
