## Best Practices for Data Governance

When implementing data governance for Azure Synapse Analytics, follow these best practices:

1. __Establish Clear Ownership__
   - Designate data owners for all data domains
   - Define clear roles and responsibilities
   - Create accountability for data quality and security

2. __Implement Comprehensive Classification__
   - Use Microsoft Purview for automated classification
   - Apply sensitivity labels consistently
   - Implement protection controls based on classification

3. __Automate Governance Processes__
   - Set up automated scanning and discovery
   - Implement automated policy enforcement
   - Configure automated lineage tracking

4. __Monitor Compliance Continuously__
   - Create dashboards for governance metrics
   - Set up alerts for policy violations
   - Perform regular compliance audits

5. __Establish Data Quality Framework__
   - Define quality dimensions and metrics
   - Implement quality validation in pipelines
   - Create remediation workflows for quality issues
