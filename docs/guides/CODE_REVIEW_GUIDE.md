## üí¨ Giving Feedback

### Feedback Categories

Use clear prefixes to categorize feedback:

| Prefix | Meaning | Action Required |
|--------|---------|-----------------|
| **`MUST:`** | Critical issue that blocks merge | Fix required |
| **`SHOULD:`** | Important improvement needed | Fix strongly recommended |
| **`CONSIDER:`** | Suggestion for improvement | Optional |
| **`NIT:`** | Minor style or preference issue | Optional |
| **`QUESTION:`** | Need clarification | Response needed |
| **`PRAISE:`** | Positive feedback | None - but appreciated! |

### Effective Feedback Examples

#### Good Feedback Examples

```markdown
**MUST:** This SQL query is vulnerable to injection attacks.
Consider using parameterized queries:
```python
# Instead of:
query = f"SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = {user_id}"

# Use:
query = "SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = %s"
cursor.execute(query, (user_id,))
```

**SHOULD:** This function is doing too many things. Consider breaking it into smaller, focused functions for better testability and readability.

**CONSIDER:** You might want to add logging here for debugging purposes, especially since this handles external API calls.

**NIT:** Variable name `d` isn't very descriptive. Maybe `document` or `doc_data`?

**QUESTION:** What happens if `response.json()` fails? Should we handle that exception?

**PRAISE:** Great use of the builder pattern here! This makes the API much more intuitive to use.
```

#### Poor Feedback Examples

```markdown
‚ùå "This is wrong." 
‚úÖ "MUST: This function doesn't handle the case where input is None."

‚ùå "Bad naming."
‚úÖ "NIT: Consider using a more descriptive variable name like `user_count` instead of `c`."

‚ùå "Why did you do it this way?"
‚úÖ "QUESTION: I'm curious about the choice to use recursion here. Have you considered an iterative approach?"
```

## üîÑ Responding to Reviews

### Response Guidelines

#### For Authors

1. **Acknowledge All Feedback**
   ```markdown
   Thanks for the thorough review! I've addressed all the MUST and SHOULD items.
   ```

2. **Be Specific About Changes**
   ```markdown
   ‚úÖ Fixed SQL injection vulnerability in user_service.py:45
   ‚úÖ Extracted validation logic into separate function
   ‚è≠Ô∏è Logging suggestion noted for future iteration
   ```

3. **Ask for Clarification When Needed**
   ```markdown
   QUESTION: Regarding the caching suggestion - are you thinking Redis or in-memory? 
   The usage pattern might affect the choice.
   ```

4. **Explain Decisions**
   ```markdown
   I kept the recursive approach because:
   1. The max depth is guaranteed to be <10
   2. It matches the tree structure naturally
   3. Stack overflow isn't a risk here
   ```

#### Response Timeline

| Feedback Type | Response Time |
|---------------|---------------|
| MUST items | Same day |
| SHOULD items | Within 2 days |
| CONSIDER items | Acknowledge within 2 days |
| QUESTIONS | Within 1 day |

## üõ†Ô∏è Review Tools

### GitHub Review Features

#### Using Review Comments

```markdown
// Good: Specific, actionable feedback
/* SHOULD: Consider extracting this complex condition into a well-named function
 * for better readability and testability.
 */
if (user.isActive && user.hasPermission('read') && !user.isBlocked) {
  // ...
}
```

#### Suggested Changes

Use GitHub's suggestion feature for simple fixes:

```diff
- const data = response.data.items.data;
+ const data = response.data?.items?.data || [];
```

### Review Automation

#### Automated Checks

```yaml
# .github/workflows/review-checks.yml
- name: Lint Check
  run: markdownlint "**/*.md"
  
- name: Test Coverage
  run: pytest --cov=80%
  
- name: Security Scan

### Review Comment Templates

```markdown
**Architecture Concern:**
This change introduces tight coupling between X and Y. Consider using dependency injection or an interface to decouple these components.

**Security Issue:**
This endpoint doesn't validate user permissions. Please add authorization checks before allowing access to user data.

**Performance Question:**
This N+1 query pattern could cause performance issues with large datasets. Have you considered using a batch query or eager loading?

**Testing Suggestion:**
Great implementation! Consider adding a test for the error case when the external API is unavailable.
```
