## Basic Queries

### Example 1: Simple Filtering and Projection

![Complexity](https://img.shields.io/badge/Complexity-Beginner-green)

#### Overview

Basic query to filter and transform streaming data from Event Hubs to Azure Synapse Analytics.

#### Prerequisites

- Stream Analytics job created
- Event Hubs input configured
- Synapse Analytics output configured

#### Query

```sql
-- =====================================================
-- Simple Filter and Projection
-- Filter high-temperature events and transform structure
-- =====================================================

WITH FilteredEvents AS (
    SELECT
        EventId,
        SensorId,
        Temperature,
        Humidity,
        Location,
        System.Timestamp() AS EventTimestamp
    FROM
        EventHubInput TIMESTAMP BY EventEnqueuedUtcTime
    WHERE
        Temperature > 30.0  -- Filter high temperature readings
        AND Humidity > 40.0
)

SELECT
    EventId,
    SensorId,
    Temperature,
    Humidity,
    Location,
    EventTimestamp,
    'HighTemperature' AS AlertType,
    CASE
        WHEN Temperature > 40.0 THEN 'Critical'
        WHEN Temperature > 35.0 THEN 'Warning'
        ELSE 'Normal'
    END AS SeverityLevel
INTO
    SynapseOutput
FROM
    FilteredEvents;
```

#### Expected Output

Stream Analytics will write records to Synapse in this format:

```json
{
  "EventId": "evt-12345",
  "SensorId": "sensor-A01",
  "Temperature": 35.2,
  "Humidity": 65.8,
  "Location": "Building-A",
  "EventTimestamp": "2024-12-09T10:30:00.000Z",
  "AlertType": "HighTemperature",
  "SeverityLevel": "Warning"
}
```

#### Common Variations

**Variation 1: Multiple Conditions**

```sql
-- Filter with multiple conditions
SELECT
    *
FROM
    EventHubInput
WHERE
    (Temperature > 30.0 OR Humidity > 80.0)
    AND Location IN ('Building-A', 'Building-B')
    AND SensorId LIKE 'sensor-A%';
```

**Variation 2: Data Type Conversions**

```sql
-- Convert and format data
SELECT
    EventId,
    CAST(Temperature AS DECIMAL(5,2)) AS Temperature,
    CAST(Humidity AS INT) AS Humidity,
    DATEADD(hour, 5, System.Timestamp()) AS LocalTimestamp
FROM
    EventHubInput;
```

---

### Example 2: Data Aggregation

![Complexity](https://img.shields.io/badge/Complexity-Beginner-green)

#### Overview

Aggregate streaming data to calculate statistics per sensor.

#### Query

```sql
-- =====================================================
-- Real-Time Aggregation
-- Calculate statistics per sensor every 1 minute
-- =====================================================

SELECT
    SensorId,
    Location,
    COUNT(*) AS EventCount,
    AVG(Temperature) AS AvgTemperature,
    MIN(Temperature) AS MinTemperature,
    MAX(Temperature) AS MaxTemperature,
    STDEV(Temperature) AS TempStdDev,
    AVG(Humidity) AS AvgHumidity,
    System.Timestamp() AS WindowEndTime
INTO
    SynapseOutput
FROM
    EventHubInput TIMESTAMP BY EventEnqueuedUtcTime
GROUP BY
    SensorId,
    Location,
    TumblingWindow(minute, 1);
```

#### Expected Output

```json
{
  "SensorId": "sensor-A01",
  "Location": "Building-A",
  "EventCount": 120,
  "AvgTemperature": 28.5,
  "MinTemperature": 25.2,
  "MaxTemperature": 32.1,
  "TempStdDev": 1.8,
  "AvgHumidity": 62.3,

## Common Patterns

### Windowing Strategies

| Window Type | Use Case | Example |
|-------------|----------|---------|
| **Tumbling** | Non-overlapping aggregations | Hourly sales totals |
| **Hopping** | Overlapping windows for trends | Moving averages |
| **Sliding** | Event-triggered windows | Pattern detection |
| **Session** | User session analytics | Web clickstream analysis |

### Performance Optimization

1. **Partition Input** - Use partition key for parallel processing
2. **Minimize Joins** - Reduce reference data joins when possible
3. **Filter Early** - Apply WHERE clauses before aggregations
4. **Use CTEs** - Common Table Expressions for complex queries

### Output Partitioning

```sql
-- Partition output by location
SELECT
    *,
    Location AS PartitionId
INTO
    PartitionedOutput PARTITION BY PartitionId
FROM
    EventHubInput;
```
