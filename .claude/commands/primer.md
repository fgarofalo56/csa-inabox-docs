Use MCP the following servers to perform the your tasks:

Start with reading the CLAUDE.md file if it exists to get an understanding of the project.

Read the README.md file to get an understanding of the project.

IMPORTANT: Use Serena to search through the codebase. If you get any errors using Serena,
retry with different Serena tools.
IMPORTANT: Check if project is onboard to Serena. If not, onboard it.
