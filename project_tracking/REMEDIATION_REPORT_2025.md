## 🟡 Partially Completed Actions

### Link Validation & Fixes

**Status:** 75% Complete

- ✅ Created all missing documentation targets
- ✅ Fixed guide cross-references
- ✅ Updated navigation links
- ⚠️ Some image references still need validation
- ⚠️ External links need verification

### Markdown Linting

**Status:** In Progress

Initial linting revealed issues:
- Heading level inconsistencies
- Trailing spaces
- Strong style formatting (asterisk vs underscore)
- Empty link references

**Recommendation:** Run `markdownlint --fix` on all files

---

## ⚠️ Remaining Issues

### 1. Image Organization

**Current Issues:**
- Duplicate image directories (`/docs/assets/images/` and `/docs/images/`)
- Missing architecture diagrams
- Inconsistent image path references

**Required Actions:**
1. Consolidate image directories
2. Create missing diagrams
3. Update all image references

### 2. Configuration Directory

**Status:** Not Created

The `/config/` directory specified in standards doesn't exist yet.

**Required Structure:**
```
config/
├── README.md
├── application/
├── environments/
├── azure/
└── templates/
```

### 3. Infrastructure Directory

**Status:** Incomplete

The `/infrastructure/` directory exists but lacks proper structure.

**Required Actions:**
1. Create subdirectories for docker, kubernetes, terraform
2. Add README files
3. Move infrastructure files to appropriate locations
