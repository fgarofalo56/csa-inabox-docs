# Link Fix Plan - Azure Synapse Analytics Documentation

## Summary of Issues

Our link checker identified 67 broken links across the documentation, primarily in these categories:

1. **Missing image references** - Several diagrams referenced in documentation don't exist
2. **Incorrect relative paths** - Links using `/` root-relative paths instead of relative paths
3. **References to non-existent pages** - Links to files that need to be created
4. **Code-related links** - Some SQL code fragments incorrectly formatted as links
5. **Cross-reference issues** - Links between documentation sections using incorrect paths

## Fix Strategy

### 1. Image References

Create missing images in the appropriate directories:

- Create `docs/images/synapse-cicd-workflow.png` for DevOps documentation
- Create `docs/images/synapse-git-configuration.png` for DevOps documentation
- Create `docs/images/monitoring-architecture.png` for monitoring documentation
- Create `docs/images/synapse-security-architecture.png` for security documentation

### 2. Relative Path Fixes

Replace incorrect root-relative paths (`/`) with proper relative paths:

- In code-examples documents, replace `/` with proper relative paths (`../` or `../../`)
- Fix CONTRIBUTING.md references to point to the correct location

### 3. Missing Files

Create the following files that are referenced but don't exist:

- `docs/monitoring/deployment-monitoring.md`
- `docs/administration/workspace-management.md`
- `docs/devops/automated-testing.md`
- `docs/monitoring/security-monitoring.md`
- `docs/best-practices/network-security.md`
- `docs/architecture/private-link-architecture.md`
- `docs/monitoring/monitoring-setup.md`
- `docs/best-practices/delta-lake-optimization.md`

### 4. Code Fragment Links

Fix SQL code fragments in these files that are incorrectly formatted as links:

- `docs/security/best-practices.md` - Fix SQL code fragments like `[TenantId]` and `@TenantId INT`
- `docs/shared-metadata/index.md` - Fix SQL code references

### 5. Cross-Reference Fixes

Update cross-reference links between documentation sections:

- Fix links in integration guides to reference the correct paths
- Update links in serverless-sql guides to point to the right locations
- Correct references between troubleshooting guides and best practices

## Priority Order

1. Fix all image references by creating missing images
2. Create missing documentation files with placeholder content
3. Fix incorrect relative paths
4. Correct SQL code fragment links
5. Update cross-references between documentation sections

## Validation

After implementing fixes:

1. Run the updated link checker again to verify all links are fixed
2. Perform manual checks of key navigation paths
3. Update CHANGELOG.md with link fixes
4. Update TASK.md with completed link fix tasks
