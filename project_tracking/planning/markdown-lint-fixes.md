# Markdown Linting Issue Fix Plan

## Issues to Address

We need to fix several markdown linting issues across the documentation to maintain consistency and follow best practices:

1. **Inline HTML elements in card-based layouts**
   - Issue: The `<div class="grid cards" markdown>` pattern creates MD033 (no-inline-html) warnings
   - Solution: Replace with MkDocs Material's native syntax if available or keep and acknowledge as an exception

2. **Trailing spaces**
   - Issue: Some files have trailing spaces (MD009) causing linting warnings
   - Solution: Remove all trailing spaces while preserving intended line breaks

3. **Strong style formatting**
   - Issue: Using asterisks (`**bold**`) instead of underscores (`__bold__`) for strong text (MD050)
   - Solution: Standardize all strong text to use underscores consistently

4. **Missing blank lines around fenced code blocks**
   - Issue: Some code blocks don't have blank lines before/after (MD031)
   - Solution: Add blank lines around all fenced code blocks

## Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Fix High-Priority Files

1. Start with files that have the most linting errors
2. Focus on the files we've recently created:
   - `docs/architecture/private-link-architecture.md`
   - `docs/best-practices/network-security.md`
   - `docs/monitoring/deployment-monitoring.md`
   - `docs/administration/workspace-management.md`
   - `docs/devops/automated-testing.md`
   - `docs/monitoring/security-monitoring.md`
   - `docs/monitoring/monitoring-setup.md`
   - `docs/best-practices/delta-lake-optimization.md`

### Phase 2: Fix Remaining Files

1. Run a linting check on all markdown files to identify remaining issues
2. Address each category of issues one by one
3. Create a verification process to ensure no new issues are introduced

### Phase 3: Document Exceptions

Some linting rules might need exceptions, particularly for the card-based layouts with inline HTML. We'll:

1. Document any intentional exceptions
2. Create a `.markdownlint.json` configuration file to specify rule exceptions where needed
3. Add comments in affected files explaining the exceptions

## Card-Based Layout Alternatives

We should investigate if Material for MkDocs offers a native solution for card-based layouts. Options include:

1. Using the built-in [grid cards](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/reference/grids/) feature from Material for MkDocs
2. Using tabbed content as an alternative organization method
3. Using other native markdown features like definition lists with custom styling

## Standardization Guidelines

To maintain consistency going forward:

1. Use underscores for strong text (`__bold__` instead of `**bold**`)
2. Ensure all fenced code blocks are surrounded by blank lines
3. Configure editors to automatically trim trailing whitespace
4. Use a consistent approach for card-based layouts

## Monitoring and Enforcement

1. Integrate markdown linting into the CI/CD process
2. Add pre-commit hooks to catch linting issues before commits
3. Document markdown standards in the project's contributing guidelines
